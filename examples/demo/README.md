# The stayfixed demo

`demo.py` builds a small repository in a scratch directory and runs `stayfixed` against it, act by
act. Each act passes only on what `stayfixed` itself answered: its exit code and the fields of the
one JSON object its `--json` prints. Nothing the script prints is read back, so an act cannot pass
on the script's own word. The recording of the demo is made from this script's run.

## What it needs

- `git`, `pytest` and `python3` on `PATH`. The script installs nothing and reaches no network.
- `claude` (Claude Code) on `PATH` for act 6, which installs the overlay's plugin through it. It
  needs no signed-in account there: `HOME` is a scratch directory. Without `claude` act 6 is
  skipped, and the skip is printed.
- Python 3.11 or later, standard library only. The script never imports `stayfixed`: it runs the
  program you give it, as a user would.

It makes no model call.

## Running it

```bash
python3 -I examples/demo/demo.py "$(command -v stayfixed)"
```

The argument is the `stayfixed` program under test. From a checkout, `uv sync` and then
`uv run python -I examples/demo/demo.py .venv/bin/stayfixed`, with `.venv/bin` on `PATH` so that
its `pytest` is the one found.

- `--keep` leaves the scratch directory in place and prints its path.
- `--require-claude` fails the run when act 6 is skipped, so a skip is never read as a pass.

Every command runs with `HOME` inside the scratch directory, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` and a fixed
author, committer and date, so your own configuration changes nothing it does.
The script exits `0` when no act failed, `1` when one did or when act 6 was skipped under
`--require-claude`, and `2` when the program is not an executable file, cannot start or exits
non-zero on `--version` (run by its own path, never through `PATH`), or when `git`, `pytest` or
`python3` is not on `PATH`.

## The acts

1. `stayfixed prove` reads a green pytest run from the runner's own report: `proved`, 2 passed.
2. A command that only prints `42 passed` proves nothing: `not proven`, `not-recognised`.
3. A run whose only test was skipped is `failed`, `all-skipped`, never a pass.
4. `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1`, which compiles assertions out, is `refused`, `assigned-forging`.
5. A fixed bug's regression, run by a gate of the project's own that `stayfixed adopt promote`
   enforces on `main`, fails `stayfixed gate` on the branch `change` that brings the bug back.
6. `stayfixed attach` binds the repository to a scratch overlay and delivers this project's skill,
   `demo-canary`, and not the other project's, `other-canary`; `git status` stays empty.
7. The `Stop`-hook recipe in `../stop-hook/`, given `pytest -q tests/test_total.py`, keeps the
   agent working on `change` (exit 2, its stderr naming `failed`), lets it stop on `main`
   (exit 0), and lets a stop through on `change` when `stop_hook_active` says the agent is already
   working on because of it (exit 0). It prints nothing on stdout on any of the three.
