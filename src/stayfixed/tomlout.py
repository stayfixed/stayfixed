"""Write TOML tables, escaping every string, refusing everything it cannot represent.

One serialiser and not one per area. `attach` writes the overlay's `projects/<name>/project.toml`
and `setup` writes the machine configuration; hand-rolled, that is two writers in two areas with no
edge between them and no escaping rule — and the value this was written for is a **git remote URL**,
which is repository-authored (principle 5). A URL carrying a quote and a newline closes its own
string and writes further keys into a record that decides what `attach` trusts.

A leaf module: it imports `stayfixed.errors` and nothing else, so either caller reaches it
without paying for an area.

One rule, stated as the module's whole contract: every string is emitted as a basic TOML string
with `"`, `\\` and the control characters escaped, and a value this cannot represent raises
rather than being mangled. Silently dropping an unexpected type, or `str()`-ing it, is how a
capability record acquires a value nobody wrote. Keys are held to the bare-key grammar for the
same reason — quoting an unexpected key would let `[project]` hold a name nobody chose to write.

**Every value `tomllib` can parse, this can emit, at any depth.** That is a wider contract than
the first draft's ("two callers and both know their own types"), and a third input made it
necessary: `setup` rewrites `~/.config/stayfixed/config.toml`, a file `README.md` documents the
owner as writing by hand. The document read back off that file is not a caller's own dict — it is
whatever a person wrote — and refusing a type merely because no caller of ours produces it wedged
the command permanently: `[personal] scale = 1.5` or `[personal.editor] name = "nvim"` made every
future `stayfixed setup` exit 2 naming a serialiser the owner has never heard of. So floats, the
four TOML date and time types, and tables nested to any depth are emitted, inside arrays as well
as outside them — "at any depth" is the part the first attempt got wrong, and a table inside an
inline table inside an array was the same permanent wedge one level further in. What is left
refused is what no TOML document could have held, which is a caller bug and still worth refusing.

**One exception, and it is about keys rather than values.** `BARE_KEY` is untouched: a key this
cannot write bare is still refused, because quoting one here would record a name nobody chose to
write. `setup.machine` catches that refusal and re-raises it naming the file, the key and the
remedy, so it cannot wedge a command silently either.

`dumps` takes `{table: {key: value}}`, and a dict in a value position becomes a sub-table
header (`[personal.editor]`, after the parent's own keys, which is the order TOML requires). A
dict *inside a list* becomes an inline table, because an array of tables has no header form
that survives being nested in a value. The one table named `""` is written before any header,
because the overlay's `projects/<name>/project.toml` holds its `remote` at the top level —
`memory.store._bound` reads it there, and moving it under a header would make this serialiser
and that reader disagree about one file.

**Comments are not preserved, and cannot be**: `tomllib` discards them on the way in, so a
rewrite of a hand-edited file keeps every table, key and value and loses the prose around them.
`setup.machine`'s docstring says the same thing where the owner's file is actually rewritten.
