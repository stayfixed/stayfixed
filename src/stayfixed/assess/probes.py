"""The probes no gate runs: what an inventory reads from files and the git index alone.

Each probe is a small function over the repository, with no network and no tool run. Its id,
principle, severity and remedy live once, on its `Probe`; the function returns only what it saw,
and `run_probes` builds the items, so the attribute a test reads off `PROBES` is the attribute
an item carries.

**A probe that could not look says so.** Every git query runs under `QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
and an exit that is not one of that query's own answers — `git_run`'s `-1` included, which is a
timeout or a git that could not start — is `unread`. So is a file
the probe cannot read or parse, and a path through a symlink. `run_probes` turns `unread` into
one `could-not-look` warning per probe and never into "nothing found": an empty answer read
from a query that did not finish would say no secret is committed.

**No repository byte can end the inventory.** Everything a probe's reading can raise on
repository content is caught where it is read and becomes `unread`.

**Nothing here is printed.** A `where` label is a path the repository chose, a sha, or this
module's own words, and it goes to the machine-readable output only; the summary that reports
these items prints counts and this module's vocabulary.

Two inventory items are not built. Another tool's design-document directories are that tool's
convention, and stayfixed names no other tool's convention. And whether a test exercises what
its name says can be judged only by reading one stack's test files, which the inventory does not
read.
