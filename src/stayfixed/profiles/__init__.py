"""Stack profiles: data under this package, read the way an installed wheel can read it.

Each directory here that holds a `profile.toml` is one profile, and its `rules.md` is required
beside it. `shipped()` is the listing `scaffold.validate_sources` checks `[stayfixed] profile`
against, and `load_profile` is the one reader. A name outside the listing is refused with fixed
text: the name arrives from a repository's `stayfixed.toml`, so it is never printed.

A stack's directory may also carry code, with a profile or without one: an optional `hygiene.py`
whose `HINT` is the stack's advice after its test runner failed (`stayfixed.profiles.hints` says
what a hint answers; the command that failed decides which of them speak, and `[stayfixed]
profile` plays no part), and an optional `adapters.py` whose `ADAPTERS` are its test runners'
adapters for `prove` (`stayfixed.profiles.runners`). One walk finds all three kinds of file,
`stack_directories`, and one import loads a stack's module, `stack_module`: the listing goes
through `importlib.resources` over this package, never over a repository path, so only code
stayfixed itself ships is ever imported.

`detects` is what `init` asks: which profile a repository looks like. `evaluate` and the
`Outcome` it returns run a profile's checks against a repository; `stayfixed assess` calls them
and reports each failed check as one item of its inventory. They live here rather than in
`stayfixed.assess` because the checks are this package's data, and a reader of them there would
be a second one.
