"""What a test runner's adapter and the core say to each other about a run and its report.

A leaf: the adapters under `profiles/<stack>/` and the `prove` core both import it, and it imports
nothing from either, so neither reaches the other through it and no package cycle forms. It is
also the public contract an adapter stayfixed does not ship implements: `RunnerAdapter`, and the
three answers its `plan` gives.

An adapter plans the command as it was typed: the launcher's words kept in front, the runner's
own words as they are, and only its report options added, so that what runs is what the command
selects. It refuses only what a person or an agent could type by mistake and get a green report
for tests that never ran or never checked anything, from a short closed list of its own.
Everything else a file in the tree, or the environment, can do is the bound's, which
`docs/cli.md` states.

No entry in `mutations/` covers this module: it declares names and records and decides nothing.
Which reader a kind is read with is `stayfixed.prove.reports.read_report`'s, and what the core
does with a plan is `stayfixed.prove.run`'s; their entries cover those.
