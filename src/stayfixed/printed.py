"""How a name the repository chose may be printed on a line a terminal or a CI runner reads.

A repository chooses its own file names, note names, `memory.groups` entries and TOML keys, and
any of them may hold a line break followed by `::error::…`, which a GitHub Actions runner reads
from a job's output as a workflow command, or an escape sequence, which drives the reader's
terminal. `trust.wrap` marks such text as data for a model and escapes no byte for either of
those readers, so a printed name needs one of the two bounds below on its content. Both answer from
`grammar.PATH_VALUE`, the one grammar a path may print in: ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`
in `/`-separated segments. A name inside it prints as itself, so ordinary output is unchanged.

- `printable` withholds a name outside the grammar. It is for a line whose command also carries
  the name in `--json`, and for any line a model reads, where a name that holds spaces could
  carry readable prose.
- `quoted` escapes a name outside the grammar with `repr`. It is for a refusal, which has no
  `--json` behind it, where withholding the name would leave the operator nothing to rename.

A third bound is on a name's length rather than its content: `clipped` prints a name through
`quoted` and, past `CLIPPED_CHARS`, only its start and its length. It is for a refusal naming
something nothing upstream bounds in length, a TOML key, a label or a group.
