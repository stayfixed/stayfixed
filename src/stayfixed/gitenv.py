"""Which `git` this project runs, the environment it is given, and the bound on how long it may
take.

One module because every caller needs the same rule, and being the same for all of them is the
point: a git answer must be a real one about the repository asked, never one an inherited
`GIT_DIR` produced. The hook path's toplevel query feeds the hook's project root
(`checkout_root` below), which every hook decision is derived from, so a query that inherited
the session's `GIT_DIR` or `GIT_WORK_TREE` would make every handler in the process answer for a
different repository than the one the user is sitting in; the memory store's queries decide
whose notes a session reads, and the same variable would choose another project's.

A leaf module: it imports `stayfixed.errors` and `stayfixed.fsops`, two leaves, and nothing else
from `stayfixed`, so the hook path pays no area import to reach it, and no caller has to import
another's area to share the constants.

`git` is the one on `PATH`, handed the environment's `PATH` and `HOME`, so that the machine
owner's `git`, `safe.directory` and excludes answer. Every other variable is dropped, every
`GIT_CONFIG_*` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` among them, so no inherited variable names another
repository or a configuration git would otherwise not read.

`git_run` is the one runner for every question this project asks git about a repository it works on
— the hook path's toplevel, the three-valued answer (`git_answer`) the memory store and
`origin_remote` read and its usability probe, the hooks directory, the dirty count and the commit
range included. One decoding boundary, and a lossless one, so no byte of git's answer can raise out
of a command and each site decides only what an answer means to it. The
`Runner` seam in `stayfixed.runner`, which launches the owner's own commands — `git clone` among
them — for their exit code and a message, is the other. One question goes through that seam
and not through `git_run`, on purpose: `stayfixed overlay publish-template`, a maintainer
command, asks `git status --porcelain` of a scratch clone it has just filled with stayfixed's own
template, beside the `add`, `commit` and `push` it runs the same way, so its tests stub all four
at one seam. It only counts and reports the changed names, and the seam reads them with a
replacement character, so a name that is not UTF-8 cannot end it as an internal error.

    ones, and git is handed `scrubbed_env`. A non-zero exit is
    returned, not collapsed — `check-ignore` answers 1 for "nothing matched", and that is an
    answer.

    **Decoded with `surrogateescape`, both ways.** git speaks bytes, and a worktree path, a
    common directory, a name in `ls-files` or a ref can hold one the filesystem's codec cannot
    decode — a latin-1 filename on Linux. Strict decoding would raise `UnicodeDecodeError` out
    of every caller as an internal error, and reading such output as no answer would throw a
    real answer away, which a caller that takes "no answer" for "nothing" turns into a pass of
    what it should refuse. Escaped, and in the
    filesystem's codec (`pipe_encoding`), a byte comes back as the same `str` `os.listdir` and
    `sys.argv` give for it, so an answer is compared with, and opens, the path it names, and a
    name read off the disk goes back to git on `stdin` as its own bytes.

    **In bytes, and decoded here rather than by `subprocess`.** Text mode translates line endings
    on the way in: each `\\r\\n` and each lone `\\r` in git's answer would come back as `\\n`, so
    a name holding a carriage return, printed raw by every `-z` query, would come back as a
    different name, and a gitignored plan so named would read as not ignored. Nothing is
    translated, either way, and git's own stderr, which nobody reads, is never decoded.

    The answer is lossless rather than a placeholder, so every caller still decides about the
    path that is really there. What it does not make safe is writing that `str` into a UTF-8
    file or parsing it as UTF-8 text: a caller whose answer ends up in one checks it itself, as
    `assess.rule.read_base` does for the base's `stayfixed.toml`.
