"""The scaffold engine: manifest, regions, keyed entries, plan and apply.

Everything a consumer needs is re-exported here, including the primitives other areas reach for
directly: `judged_entries` for `doctor`'s provenance list, each entry a `Placed`, and for
`assess`'s foreign-hook probe, which reads the same walk; `wanted_placements` for the grants it
is compared with, which `attach` answers; `owned_ids` for the ids `attach` records in its
ledger, `mark` for any caller that builds `Template.entries`, and `drop` / `apply_entries` for
`uninstall`. The three refusals a consumer has to catch by name
are here too: a caller that cannot import `ManifestError`, `RegionError` or `EntriesError`
from this list has no way to tell a bad merge from a bug except by catching `Refusal` whole;
`ParserLimitError`, an `EntriesError` too, is the valid JSON past a limit of the parser that
`doctor` must tell from a malformed document. `effective_target` and
`unlinks` are for `uninstall`, which must compare paths the way the engine resolves them (an
`[artifacts] local` artifact lives where `Template.target` does not say) and must know which
planned removal deletes a file rather than rewriting it without stayfixed's part: both are the
engine's facts, and a second copy of either would drift from it. `ours_locally`, `local_copies`
and `left_copies` are for `uninstall` too
(the last two through the project area's planning seam, `project.footprint.Passes`): before any
write it predicts whether the write-once pass will remove what a region's removal
leaves in a file kept out of git, and that verdict, which file it is asked of, and which copy a
`--force` meant for the footprint pass names, are the engine's own rule for such a file.
`LocalDigests` and `LOCAL_DIGESTS` are the ledger that rule reads, which `uninstall` removes before
the ignore block goes. `LOCAL_ARTIFACTS` is for the project area's guard against writes git
ignores, which exempts the one directory stayfixed keeps out of git on purpose. Importing a private
module of this package from another area is a review finding; if an area needs something this
list does not carry, the list grows deliberately.
