"""Decide, then write.

`plan` reads and decides; `apply` writes. The split is what makes `--dry-run` honest — the
report a user approves is produced by the same code path that then runs — and it is what makes
the containment rule testable without a filesystem full of traps.

Two rules are easy to state and easy to get backwards, so they are stated here once.

*An absent record does not mean "hands off" for every kind.* For a whole file it does: a file
stayfixed never wrote is somebody's. For a managed region and for keyed entries the file
belongs to somebody by definition, and an absent record is the ordinary first install — the
rules for regions and for keyed entries exist for exactly that case. The hand-edit oracle for
those two kinds is the region body and the marked entries, never the file around them.

*A refusal is an artifact's, not the plan's.* A file that cannot be read, a region whose markers
no longer say where it ends, a settings document that is not JSON: each is recorded in
`Plan.refusals` and the remaining templates are still decided. `plan` raises only for input no
per-artifact report could rescue — the configured profile, the manifest itself, and a malformed
`Template`, which is a bug in the caller that built it rather than a file a user can put right.
Both shapes of malformed `Template` raise, symmetrically: a managed region that names no
region, and keyed entries that name no entries. The second did not, and `entries or {}` turned
it into a silent uninstall of whatever the user had wired up.

*Containment is not a string check.* `contained()` decides whether a path may be written;
`fsops.open_within` decides what is actually written to, by walking the path with `O_NOFOLLOW`
and handing back a descriptor. A component can still become a symlink after `contained()` has
passed — that is the race this layer exists to survive — but it cannot redirect the write: the
walk fails the open rather than following the link, and the string is never resolved a second
time, not for the write and not for the parent directories, which `fsops.mkdirs_within`
creates one component at a time through the same walk rather than with `Path.mkdir`.

    The recorded target is repository-controlled through the committed manifest, so "does this
    record describe the file I am about to delete" cannot rest on the record alone: a committed
    manifest naming any in-root file, stamped with the bytes that file is committed with, would
    otherwise make `plan` emit a `REMOVE` for it. So the recorded target must be one of the two
    paths this template can produce — its configured target, or that target under
    `LOCAL_ARTIFACTS` — before anything else is asked. It is then contained before it is read,
    exactly like a configured one.

    **Always an `Action`, never `None`.** Every branch that declines to remove the old file used
    to answer `None`, and `plan` read that as "nothing to do here" and carried on creating the
    file at the new target — so a relocated artifact whose old file a user had hand-edited was
    left on disk holding that edit, the manifest ended empty, and the report said "0 skipped,
    0 refused". `apply`'s own comment calls that state a defect: "a file stayfixed wrote carrying
    no record, which every later run reads as somebody else's … invisible to `uninstall`". The
    symmetric `_plan_retired` path has always emitted `skip_modified` for it.

    So the three ways the old file is not stayfixed's to remove — a recorded target this template
    could not have produced, one that no longer contains, and one whose bytes are not the ones
    recorded — each become a `skip_modified` naming the old path and saying which it was.
