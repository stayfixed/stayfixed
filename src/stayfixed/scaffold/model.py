"""What a consumer asks for, and what the engine answers.

`Template` is a description, not a file: the areas that own template *content*
(`templates/`, `overlay/`) build these, and this area never reads the plugin's own directory.
That is what keeps the engine testable without shipping any template at all.

    rewritten, before `apply` consumed it. That weakens the one claim this split exists to make:
