"""The binding id in a repository's git common directory, and the machine's record of what it binds.

**The id is the anchor, and a secret.** A checkout is bound when this machine wrote an id into its
git common directory, `<common>/stayfixed/binding`, and a record of what that id is bound to under
its own data directory, `<data>/bindings/<id>.toml`. Repository bytes cannot write the common
directory, because `.git/` is in no tree, and a clone never carries it, so a clone that commits
the `[project] name` of one of the owner's projects has no id and nothing on this machine binds
it. The id never leaves the machine: it is not written into the overlay, which is pushed and
shared, nor into any tracked file, and it is printed only as `short`, its first eight characters.
The rendered delivery's names carry it, so a clone cannot name what it never saw. The agent in a
session is not this anchor's adversary.

**The common directory, never a per-worktree path.** It is `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute
--git-common-dir`, asked through `gitenv`, which scrubs `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE`: `git
rev-parse --git-path` maps only git's own names to the common directory and resolves any other
per worktree, so an id kept there would leave every linked worktree unbound. Every worktree of one
repository reads the one id.

**The project comes from the record, never from the repository.** `bound_project` reads no
`stayfixed.toml`. What an id is bound to — the project's name, the `origin` at attach time and the
checkout's path — is the machine's own file, under `config.paths.data_directory`, which follows
`HOME` as the machine configuration does, so two machines attaching one overlay project each keep
their own id and their own record.
