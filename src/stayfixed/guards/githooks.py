"""The chained `prepare-commit-msg` hook and its per-repository installer.

Installed into `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`, never through `core.hooksPath`: a global
setting is overridden by any repository that sets its own and silently competes with husky
elsewhere on the machine, while `--git-path` honours a `core.hooksPath` the repository already
has — computing `<common-dir>/hooks` by hand would install into a directory git never reads
when one is set. Hooks resolve from the common directory, so one installation covers the main
checkout and every worktree.

A foreign hook of the same name is kept as `<name>.local` and the shipped hook `exec`s it
last, so nothing that was already running stops running. `uninstall` puts it back.

This is the one place this area writes outside a project root on purpose: the hooks directory is
git's, and in a worktree it is not under the checkout at all. The writes are
`fsops.write_atomically` on the hook path and a rename of the foreign hook beside it, and both paths
are named in `docs/cli.md`'s **Writes** paragraph for `stayfixed setup --git-hooks`, as the
enumerated-writes rule (CONTRIBUTING.md#enumerated-writes) asks of every path a command writes.
