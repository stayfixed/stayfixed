    """`ledger.code_roots` that pass `contained()` and exist as directories, in config order.

    `config.paths` says the four path-shaped fields it does not guard and names
    `ledger.code_roots` first; this is the call it asks the consuming module to make.

    NO DIRECTORY IS RETURNED TWICE, and no directory under another returned one is returned
    beside it. Every consumer of this list walks each entry and adds up what it
    finds, so `code_roots = ["src", "src"]` doubled every stale `.pyc` in the count the
    hygiene notice prints, and `["src", "src/stayfixed"]` doubled the part of the tree they
    share -- a wrong number in a notice whose whole job is to be believed about a number.

    **An entry is folded before it is asked about.** `contained()` refuses a trailing `/`, a
    doubled `/` and a leading `./` since it shares the write's component rule, and that rule is
    right for a target the engine writes. A code root is only walked, and `"src/"` is the way
    many people write a directory: refused here, it was dropped from the hygiene counts and the
    citation roots with nothing saying so. `PurePosixPath` folds exactly those
    three spellings and nothing else -- it keeps `..` and an absolute root, which `contained()`
    still refuses.

    Comparing the paths `contained()` returns is enough to collapse two spellings of one
    directory, not just two copies of one spelling: the fold above has already removed `./`
    and repeated separators, and `contained()` refuses a `..` component, an absolute path and a
    symlink anywhere from the root to the target inclusive -- so no two surviving entries can
    name the same directory by different routes. Order is the config's. Between an ancestor
    and a descendant the ANCESTOR wins whichever way round they are written, because it is the
    wider walk and dropping it would lose files; between two entries naming the same
    directory, the first keeps its place.
