"""The background-cleanup judge: two refusals and one hint about a cleanup a reap can skip.

MEASURED 2026-09-02. A session reproducing a timing flake under CPU contention ran this as
ONE backgrounded command::

    for i in $(seq 1 14); do (while :; do :; done) & done
    LOADPIDS=$(jobs -p)
    sleep 2
    PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src .venv/bin/python .../rate.py 15 2>&1 | grep -E '^idle|^under|failures'
    kill $LOADPIDS 2>/dev/null

The harness reaped the parent shell before the `kill` line. The fourteen subshells were
`&`-backgrounded, so they survived, re-parented to PID 1, and busy-looped for 39 minutes at
~56% CPU each -- 7.4 of 10 cores -- until a later session found them. Their owning session had
ended and its PR had merged, so nothing was left that could ever have stopped them, and a
sibling session read the load as ambient contention and held a paid eval run waiting for it
to clear.

WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT FIX, stated so the boundary stays clear: the harness reaps the parent
shell without killing its process group. That is agent-harness behaviour, not repository
behaviour, and nothing here works around it.

WHAT IT CAN FIX is the command SHAPE, which is where the leak is actually authored. Cleanup
expressed as a trailing line of the same command is not cleanup -- it runs only if the shell
survives to reach it, which is exactly the assumption a reap breaks. `trap 'kill ...' EXIT INT
TERM` runs where a trailing line does not, because the shell fires it on the way out however it
leaves. So the rules below refuse that shape before it starts where refusing is right and
advise where it is not, each naming the remedy rather than the rule alone.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES, four readings of that one shape:

1. It REFUSES a backgrounded command that leaks an `&` job with no trap (`LEAK_REASON`).
2. It REFUSES a backgrounded command whose FIRST simple command is `sleep` (`SLEEP_REASON`).
3. It ADVISES -- never refuses -- when a command's last line restores a backup outside a trap
   (`RESTORE_HINT`).
4. It ADVISES, for a backgrounded call only, when the chain ends in `; echo …`, because the
   harness's completion notification reports that echo's exit code and not the code of the
   command before it (`EXIT_ECHO_HINT`). It cannot fire together with 3: a restore is a last
   command, and so is the echo.

THE `&` RULE, all three conditions required:

1. The call carries `run_in_background: true`. Keying on the flag is what keeps false
   positives near zero: a foreground command that leaks is a much rarer accident, because the
   shell that would run the trailing line is the one the tool is waiting on.
2. The command backgrounds a job with a bare `&`. Read as a TOKEN from `bashscan.tokenize`,
   never as a regex over raw text -- `&&` and `2>&1` are precisely what a text scan gets
   wrong, and the tokenizer already resolves both (`a && b` -> `['a', '&&', 'b']`,
   `cmd 2>&1` -> `['cmd', '2', '>&', '1']`, neither yielding a bare `&`). Read, too, from a
   command whose heredoc BODIES are gone -- every one of them, quoted delimiter or not: a
   body is standard input to the header's command, never an operator of the enclosing shell,
   and reading one as grammar refused an ordinary `cat > README.md <<EOF` whose text carried
   a `&`. `_scan` carries that measurement.
3. No `trap` naming `EXIT` anywhere in the command.

THE `sleep` RULE is one condition on top of the flag: the first simple command is `sleep`.
A backgrounded call returns at once -- the harness does not wait for it -- so the sleep buys
nothing and the check after it runs immediately, in the background, unread. Measured
2026-09-05: fifteen such calls, nine 'minutes' of sleeping, 39 seconds of wall clock. It
refuses rather than advises because there is no shape where a backgrounded leading `sleep`
does what its author meant. Only the FIRST command counts: `pytest ...; sleep 1` is not the
misunderstanding.

THE RESTORE HINT is the one behaviour NOT keyed on `run_in_background`, deliberately: the
shape it names was measured 2026-09-05 on a FOREGROUND call, which outlived the 120 s timeout,
was backgrounded by the harness and reaped before its restore line, leaving a workflow file
mutated. The flag cannot key it because at PreToolUse time the timeout has not happened. That
is also why its matching is the narrowest thing in this file: it reads every Bash call, so it
fires only on the ROUND TRIP -- an earlier `cp`/`mv` whose source and destination the last
command swaps back -- and stays silent on an ordinary chained copy (`cp src/a build/a; make;
cp build/a dist/a`), which shares the last command's shape and restores nothing. It is advice
and never a refusal, so a miss costs nothing and a false fire is noise on every `cp` anyone
writes.

NO EXEMPTION FOR A LONE `cmd &`, and this was the one judgement call the rule left open: should
a bare `&` on a command that is itself the only thing being run -- a server the caller means to
outlive the shell -- be allowed? It is not, because under `run_in_background: true` the harness
ALREADY backgrounds the whole command. An inner `&` therefore adds nothing but a child the
harness cannot track and the reap cannot collect: either it is redundant (drop it, and the tool
still backgrounds the command) or it is the leak (a server nothing will reap is the same defect
as fourteen busy-loops nothing will reap, differing only in how much CPU it burns). There is no
shape where the inner `&` is both necessary and safe, so there is nothing to exempt.
`test_a_lone_backgrounded_server_is_denied_too` pins the decision rather than leaving it to be
rediscovered.

DEGRADES TOWARD SILENCE at every seam where it can degrade at all, with ONE measured
exception named below: an unparseable command is allowed, a trap this reads too generously is
allowed, and a `&` nested past the recursion bound is allowed. That direction is deliberate.
This guard exists to stop a shape people write BY ACCIDENT, not to hold a line against someone
spelling around it -- and a guard that fires on ordinary work is one people learn to route
around rather than obey.

THE EXCEPTION, stated rather than left for someone to trip over: a BITWISE `&` inside an
arithmetic expansion is refused. `echo $((3 & 1))` tokenizes to
`['echo', '$', '((', '3', '&', '1', '))']`, and that `&` is bare. The obvious fix -- suppress
`&` inside a run opened by `((` -- was measured and rejected, because `((` is not unambiguous:
`((sleep 1; sleep 2) & wait)` opens with the same token, and suppressing there would silence a
REAL leak that is far closer to the incident than any arithmetic is
(`test_a_subshell_background_inside_another_subshell_is_denied` pins that shape). Refusing a
rare bitwise expression is the cheaper error of the two, and backgrounding one is not a thing
anyone does on purpose.

WHAT IS NOT COVERED, recorded rather than implied:

- BY EITHER REFUSAL, a command the harness moves to the background ITSELF, after the
  foreground timeout, with no `run_in_background` in the payload. The flag is the only signal
  available at PreToolUse time; the timeout has not happened yet and nothing in the input
  predicts it. The restore hint is the one behaviour that does not need the flag, and it is
  unkeyed for exactly this reason.
- `trap - EXIT`, which REMOVES a trap rather than installing one, reads here as a trap and
  allows. Distinguishing it is one condition, and it is deliberately not written: it buys
  nothing against an accident, and every line spent narrowing the trap test is a line that can
  produce a false refusal on a real trap spelled unusually.
- A `&` inside a `$(...)` substitution, or in a body fed to a LANGUAGE interpreter rather than
  a shell (`python3 - <<'PY'`). The first is exotic -- a substitution's output is captured, so
  backgrounding inside one is not a shape that occurs by accident -- and the second is not
  shell grammar, so re-reading it as shell would be judging the wrong language.
- A shell `-c` command string that another option in the same cluster displaces, as in
  `bash -cO extglob '<command>'`. `_nested_programs` takes the token after the cluster and
  only that one; reading further was measured to REFUSE ordinary quoted arguments, which is
  the wrong direction to be wrong in.
- A backup copied INTO A DIRECTORY (`cp ci.yml bak/`, `cp -t bak ci.yml`, `cp a b bak`). The
  backup then lives at `bak/ci.yml`, a path this reader would have to construct rather than
  read, so no round trip can be recognised and the hint stays silent. Recorded rather than
  built: guessing the joined path is the kind of reach that turns a hint into noise.
- A restore line carrying a redirect (`cp a.bak a 2>/dev/null`), on either side of the round
  trip. `segments` keeps the redirect pieces in the segment and this reader counts them as
  operands, so the command looks multi-operand and comes back silent -- verified both ways
  rather than assumed.
- A command longer than `MAX_COMMAND_CHARS`, which is not read at all. See that constant.

    the very thing this guard exists to refuse, was allowed. So was the module docstring's own
    incident command with a single space deleted (`done)& done`). `_installs_an_exit_trap`
    never had the problem because it goes through `bashscan.segments`, which decomposes such
    runs; this was the one place that skipped the decomposition. `bashscan`'s own header
    records the identical defect being fixed inside that module ("A SEPARATOR WELDED TO ITS
    NEIGHBOUR IS STILL A SEPARATOR"), so the lesson was available and simply not applied here.

    Interpreting the pieces, rather than just scanning them, is the other half. `|&`, `;&` and
    `;;&` decompose to single characters by design, and each of their `&`s belongs to a pipe
    or a case fall-through, never to an async operator -- so a `&` directly preceded by `|` or
    `;` is skipped. See `_COMMAND_ENDING_PIECES`.

    OPTIONS FIRST, because position alone is not the answer and reading it as one was the

    `cp -a X X.bak` and `cp -p X X.bak` are how the measured incident ("mutate, test,
    restore") is ordinarily written, and both were invisible; `mv -t DIR src` was worse than
    invisible, reading a SOURCE as the destination.

    The split is deliberately shallow, and each decision is a direction to be wrong in:

    - Any token starting with `-` is an option and is dropped, INCLUDING a long option with an
      inline value (`--preserve=all`) -- which is why nothing here consumes a following token
      except the two that genuinely take one. A bare `-` is stdin/stdout, so it is an operand.
    - `--` ends option parsing, by the same getopt convention `_OPTION_TERMINATOR` already
      serves in this file; every token after it is an operand however it is spelled.
    - `-t DIR` / `--target-directory[=]DIR` name the destination, and every operand is then a
      source. NOT the inline cluster spelling `-tDIR`, which is dropped whole -- option and
      value together -- leaving the remaining operands to be read positionally and the
      destination wrong (measured: `cp -tDIR a b` reports `b`). Unpacking short-option clusters
      is real work for a spelling nobody writes, `cp -t` being rare already, and what it leaves
      behind is one pair in the backups set that a round trip has to match exactly before
      anything is said. Recorded rather than fixed, in the direction this file records the
      rest of its misses.
    - FEWER THAN TWO OPERANDS and no `-t` (`cp --`, `cp --help`, `cp x`) is not a move at all:
      None, rather than an index error on a command that names no destination.

    `into_directory` records that the destination is a DIRECTORY rather than a file, which the
    command's own shape says two ways: `-t` always means one, and so does a third operand
    (`cp a b DIR` cannot mean anything else). The backup then lives at `DIR/<name>`, a path

    Both halves are collected over the WHOLE command tree rather than judged per simple
    command, because the question this guard asks is about the command as a whole: does it
    leave a process nothing will reap? A trap installed anywhere excuses a `&` written
    anywhere, which is both the shell's own reading -- an EXIT trap fires for the shell that
    installed it, whichever line backgrounded the job -- and the permissive direction.

    HEREDOC BODIES ARE NOT GRAMMAR, which is why both reads below ask for tokens with every
    body removed rather than `bashscan`'s default text. `prepare` re-inserts an UNQUOTED body
    into the scanned text, and that is right for a caller matching paths or words, because the
    shell expands such a body. It is wrong here, because a body is standard input to the
    header's command and never an operator of the enclosing shell. Measured, both directions,
    before this was keyed off:

    - `cat > README.md <<EOF` / `see https://h/p?a=1&b=2 for $USER` / `EOF` was DENIED. An
      unquoted delimiter is what a writer must use to get `$VAR` expanded, so writing any file
      whose content carries an `&` was refused outright by the one `Policy.CLOSED` handler.
    - `cat > notes.md <<EOF` / `don't stop for $USER` / `EOF` / `sleep 5 &` was ALLOWED. The
      apostrophe opened a quote that never closed, `tokenize` returned `None`, and a real
      unreaped job walked through the `None` path below.

    The bodies that ARE programs keep being judged, unchanged: `prepare` reports every heredoc
    whatever the flag says about the text, and `_nested_programs` picks the shell-fed ones out
    of that list and recurses into them.

    An unparseable command (unbalanced quotes) yields `(False, False)` and is therefore
    allowed. There is no fail-closed fallback available: the token this reader needs is `&`,
    the one thing a raw-text scan provably gets wrong, so a text-level fallback would refuse
    ordinary quoted arguments. With the bodies gone, an unbalanced quote in what remains is
    a command no shell would run -- which is the claim this docstring used to make about the
