"""Name what could have falsified a red test run, before the diff is blamed.

Uncommitted work in the tree produces a red run that no baseline A/B can attribute, because both
halves of the A/B run inside it: the measurement describes a tree nobody is merging. It has cost
real time, twice in one branch's retro. It belongs to no stack and is named here; a fault that
is one stack's own, such as Python's stale bytecode, is named by that stack's profile
(`stayfixed.profiles.hints`).

Warn-only by construction: the tool has already run, and the verdict this guards is the
human's next sentence, not the command. Once per context, which the dispatcher's `once_key`
owns (see `hooks.py`, and `stayfixed.hooks.dispatch`, which decides and banks the one delivery, for
what that currently means).

Which hints speak is decided by the command that failed, never by configuration: the command is
split into simple commands with the shared scanner's tokens and segments, each unwrapped as
`RedRunHint.recognises` describes, and every shipped hint is asked whether it recognises one of
them. When none does, nothing is said, the dirty-tree line included: the core cannot tell a
failed test run from a failed `grep`, and the one delivery per context belongs to the first
failed test run. A command the scanner cannot read is recognised by nobody
(`simple_commands`).

Which harness field says a run was red is read from the documentation, not guessed: the Claude
Code hooks reference gives the Bash `tool_response` as `stdout`, `stderr`, `interrupted` and
`isImage` with no exit code, and a non-zero exit arriving on `PostToolUseFailure` as
`error: "Exit code N\\n…"`. `red_exit` reads both that shape and a `tool_response.exit_code`,
so the notice is keyed on whichever the harness sends rather than on a field one lacks.

Nothing a repository authored leaves this module. The notice carries the fixed sentences below,
counts this module computed, and lines a shipped hint rendered from its own counts.
