"""Handlers this area contributes; the `hook <event>` entries in `hooks/hooks.json` invoke them.

Every import of `stayfixed.guards.*` and of the configuration layer happens **inside** a
handler body. `tests/boundaries/test_discovery.py` asserts that `discover()` in a clean
interpreter imports neither the configuration layer nor the presets, and discovery imports every
area's `hooks` module — so a module-level import here reddens a test that belongs to no area at
all.

`bg-cleanup` only hints: the agent in the session writes the command it judges, so a refusal
would be a convenience it could spell around, and a hint costs a legitimate command nothing.

Nothing a repository controls is put into `HookResult.context`. The restore hint is built from
the command's own text — model- or user-authored, never repository bytes — and the hygiene
notice carries counts and fixed sentences, its own and those a shipped profile's hint renders
from its counts, never a path from `stayfixed.toml`.

The guard judges with any configuration and none: a repository with no `stayfixed.toml`, or one
that does not load, is judged as one that loads, because the guard reads nothing of it but its
switch. A repository's `[guards]` sets the switch's default, and the owner's layers override it,
the machine file last (`config.session`). The hygiene note is about the project and is silent
without its configuration.
