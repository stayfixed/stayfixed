"""Bash-command scanning shared by the PreToolUse guards.

The one promise every caller here relies on: this module reports what the TEXT of a command
says, and a caller judges that text. It never runs anything, and it must never hand a caller
LESS text than a shell would execute -- every place below that discards text is a place a
command can hide in, so each one is justified individually and none of them discards text a
shell would run.

Comments are removed BEFORE tokenizing (`strip_comments`), and the lexer's own comment mode
is switched off by `tokenize`. `shlex`'s `commenters='#'` ends a token at ANY unquoted `#`,
which a shell does not do -- a `#` only opens a comment at the START of a word. The
difference is not cosmetic: `shlex` truncated `echo a#b && cat secrets/.env` to
`['echo', 'a']` and dropped the rest of the command on the floor, which made every check
built on these tokens blind to whatever followed.

Heredocs (`scan_heredocs`) are where the same promise was previously broken outright. The
original implementation stripped every heredoc body, quoted delimiter and unquoted alike,
before any check ran -- so `bash <<EOF` / `cat secrets/.env` / `EOF` presented the
scanner with nothing but the word `bash`, and every guard built on it allowed the command.
Two different things were being conflated:

- What a QUOTED delimiter (`<<'TAG'`, `<<"TAG"`, `<<\\TAG`) buys is that the body is not
  EXPANDED -- no variable, no substitution, no glob. It buys nothing about whether the body
  is EXECUTED: `bash <<'EOF'` runs its body exactly as `bash <<EOF` does.
- What the ORIGINAL stripping was for is a genuine and separate need: this repository's own
  guard tests write fixture files whose content legitimately mentions protected names, and a
  scanner that read `cat > tests/x.py <<'EOF'`'s body could never let its own tests be
  authored.

So the two questions are answered separately, and neither answer is allowed to stand in for
the other:

1. QUOTING decides whether the body stays in the text handed back for general scanning. A
   quoted body is inert data as far as expansion goes and is removed, which is what keeps
   fixture authoring possible. An unquoted body is expanded by the shell and is KEPT, so
   every token in it is visible to the caller's ordinary checks.
2. THE COMMAND THE HEREDOC FEEDS decides whether the body is also handed back as COMMAND
   TEXT, regardless of quoting. `scan_heredocs` returns every heredoc it found, each with
   the header line carrying its redirect, so a caller can ask whether that line's command is
   a shell or an interpreter and judge the body as a command in its own right. A body fed to
   `cat`/`tee` is data; a body fed to `bash`/`python3` is a program.

An unterminated QUOTED heredoc still strips to the end of the command -- there is no
terminator to stop at, and the caller treats missing evidence as absence. An unterminated
UNQUOTED heredoc keeps every remaining line, for the same reason its terminated form does.

WHICH `<<` IS A REDIRECT AT ALL is a quoting question too, and answering it by regex alone
was a live false-open (`_quoted_spans`). `_HEREDOC.finditer` used to run against the RAW
line, so a `<<'TAG'` sequence that merely APPEARED INSIDE A QUOTED STRING was taken for a
real quoted heredoc and every following line up to a `TAG` line -- or, with no such line, to
the end of the command -- was deleted from the text every caller reads. `git commit -m "note
<<'E' "` followed by any second line is enough, which makes this reachable by accident and
not only on purpose; the deleted line could equally have been `cat <an env file>` or
`sed -i '' ... scripts/guard.py`. `strip_comments` above already tracks quote state
carefully for exactly this class of question, and `scan_heredocs` now does the same, carrying
the state ACROSS lines so a newline inside a quoted string does not reset it. Quote state
deliberately does NOT advance through a heredoc BODY: a body is data to the shell's parser,
not a place quotes open and close. And when the quotes do not balance -- a command no shell
would run -- the quote-aware pass is thrown away and the scan redone without it, because a
wrong "this is inside a string" verdict HIDES a real heredoc from the caller; that regression
was measured, not imagined (see `scan_heredocs`).

A NEWLINE IS A COMMAND SEPARATOR, and `_newlines_to_separators` is what makes the rest of the
module see that. `shlex` with `whitespace_split = True` discards a newline as ordinary
whitespace, so `segments` never saw a break and a multi-line command collapsed into ONE
segment whose argv0 was the FIRST line's program. Token-based checks survive that -- they
scan every token -- but any argv0-keyed caller then judges the whole command by its first
line: `echo hi` + newline + `rm scripts/guard.py` presented one segment beginning `echo`,
while the same command spelled with `;` presented two. Rewriting the newline to a
space-padded `;` discards nothing and restores the shell's own reading. It must run LAST,
after `strip_comments` and `scan_heredocs`: both are line-based, and a `;` where they expect
a line break would make a comment swallow the rest of the command and a heredoc lose its body
boundaries.

A SEPARATOR WELDED TO ITS NEIGHBOUR IS STILL A SEPARATOR (`operator_pieces`). This is the
same defect as the newline one, and it was found while fixing it: `shlex`'s
`punctuation_chars` mode emits a RUN of adjacent punctuation as ONE token, so `);`, `;;`,
`&;`, `));` and `;>` are none of them members of `_SEPARATORS`, and `segments` carried
straight past them into a single segment. No newline and no obfuscation is needed to reach
it: measured on this module, `(cd /tmp); rm scripts/guard.py` tokenized to
`['(', 'cd', '/tmp', ');', 'rm', 'scripts/guard.py']` and `echo hi;>scripts/guard.py` to
`['echo', 'hi', ';>', 'scripts/guard.py']`, and a membership-only split returned each whole,
as ONE segment -- one an ordinary subshell followed by an ordinary semicolon, the other an
ordinary redirect. `segments` now decomposes such a run into the operators bash reads it as,
which also restores a caller's redirect lookback: the `>` of a fused `;>` becomes the first
token of the new segment, so a caller asking whether the piece before a path is a redirect
operator can see it.

Tokenizing is built on `shlex.shlex` directly rather than `shlex.split`: `punctuation_chars`
is a constructor argument of `shlex.shlex`, not a parameter of the `split()` convenience
function, so `shlex.split(..., punctuation_chars=True)` raises `TypeError`. Constructing the
lexer directly, with `whitespace_split = True`, keeps `punctuation_chars`' behaviour of
surfacing redirects and separators (`>`, `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&`) as their own tokens.

The heredoc-recognition regex intentionally accepts a narrower shape than bash's full
grammar. It only calls a `<<`/`<<-` a heredoc redirect when: the character before it is not
a word character (excludes the arithmetic shift `1<<3`, which is never a redirect); the
character right after `<<`/`<<-` is not another `<` (excludes the here-string `<<<`, a
different operator entirely); and the delimiter word is followed by whitespace or end of
line, not by another non-space character (excludes `$((1 << 3))`, where the "delimiter"
would otherwise be the digit run before the closing parens). This is deliberately
conservative: a no-space form like `cat<<EOF` (delimiter preceded by a word character) is
also rejected, even though bash accepts it. Missing that shape now leaves its body
unstripped AND unrecognised as a command body -- the body's own tokens are still visible to
the caller's scan, and the newline rewriting above makes each of those lines a segment of
its own, so an argv0-keyed check sees them too; only the shell-body recursion does not run
for it. Wrongly treating an arithmetic shift as a heredoc start, by contrast,
silently discards every following line, which is exactly the false-open failure this module
exists to avoid.

A BACKSLASH-NEWLINE PAIR IS A LINE CONTINUATION (`_strip_line_continuations`), and until
that function existed nothing in the module joined one: `shlex` strips the backslash but
leaves the newline sitting inside the token, so `cat secrets/\\<newline>.env` presented every
path-matching check with a token that never equalled `secrets/.env` -- measured as passing an
env read, a boundary write, a boundary removal (confirmed deleting a real file in a
disposable tree), and a sealed-script invocation. Bash joins the pair both outside quotes and
inside double quotes, but never inside single quotes, where `\\<newline>` stays two literal
characters -- verified with `bash -c` and `od -c` for both directions.
`_strip_line_continuations` matches that exactly rather than stripping the pair everywhere: a
quote-blind global strip would invent a match in an argument bash never produces
(`'secrets/\\<newline>.env'` is not the path `secrets/.env` to bash, only to a scanner that
stopped looking at quotes), which is a false denial, not a bypass -- but it is still a wrong
model of the command, and this module has already paid once for a wrong model of what bash
executes. See the function's own docstring for the placement in `prepare`'s pipeline, which
is exactly as load-bearing as the ordering already documented above for comments, heredocs,
and newlines.

    Expects comment-stripped text (see `strip_comments` for why that order); `prepare`
    below is the entry point that guarantees it.

    Only a QUOTED delimiter's body is removed. An unquoted body is expanded by the shell, so
    every line of it stays in the returned text and reaches the caller's ordinary token scan.
    Both kinds are reported in the list, because quoting says nothing about whether the body
    is EXECUTED -- see the module docstring.

    ``keep_unquoted_bodies=False`` removes those bodies too, and is for the one caller shape
    that asks a GRAMMAR question rather than a text one. A body is standard input to the
    header's command; it is never command syntax of the enclosing shell. Keeping it is right
    for a caller matching paths or words, because the shell expands it -- and wrong for a
    caller asking "does this command carry an async operator", for which a bare `&` in a
    README line is data and an apostrophe in one is not an unbalanced quote. Both kinds are
    still reported in the list, so a caller that wants to judge a shell-fed body as a program
    still has it. See `bgcleanup._scan`, which is that caller.

    Multiple redirects on one line (`cmd <<A <<B`) are consumed in order, the way bash reads
    them, rather than only the first: taking one per line and leaving the rest to be
    rediscovered would misalign every body after it.

    A `<<TAG` INSIDE A QUOTED STRING is not a redirect (`_quoted_spans`). Skipping such a
    match is the only direction that can be taken here: treating it as a heredoc deletes
    every following line from the text -- the exact false-open this module exists to prevent,
    and reachable by typing an ordinary `git commit -m "... <<'E' "`. Quote state is carried
    from line to line, because a quoted string may span newlines, but it is deliberately NOT
    advanced through a heredoc BODY: to the shell's parser a body is data, so an apostrophe
    in it opens nothing.

    THE QUOTE-AWARE PASS IS ABANDONED WHEN ITS OWN PREMISE FAILS, and this is not a nicety:
    it was measured turning a deny into an allow. If the quotes do not balance over the lines
    the shell actually parses, then "this `<<` is inside a string" is an unreliable claim, and
    acting on it hides a REAL heredoc from the caller. Measured: `echo "unbalanced` + newline
    + `bash <<'EOF'` + `rm scripts/guard.py` + `EOF` is returned as one `Heredoc` by the two-
    pass scan and as NO heredoc at all under the quote-aware pass alone -- so the only route
    this module offers to a shell-fed body as a PROGRAM (the list a caller like
    `bgcleanup._nested_programs` reads) comes back empty, and a body that is a command line is
    left to whatever a caller's ordinary token scan makes of it. So the pass runs, and if it
    ends still inside a quote the whole scan is redone with quote tracking OFF -- exactly what
    the quote-blind scan did, for exactly the commands that cannot balance their quotes.
    Nothing is given up by that: bash will not run an unbalanced command either, so every
    command a shell would EXECUTE gets the quote-aware answer. The balance is judged only
    over non-body lines, which is why the fallback does not fire for the ordinary
    `cat > x <<'EOF'` / `don't` / `EOF` shape.

    Lines are split on `\\n` alone rather than by `str.splitlines`, which also breaks on
    `\\v`, `\\f`, `\\x1c`-`\\x1e`, `\\x85`, `\\u2028` and `\\u2029`. A shell treats none of
    those as a line break, and since `_newlines_to_separators` now turns every line break
    into a COMMAND SEPARATOR, an invented break would invent a command -- and would also
    silently rewrite such a character inside a quoted argument. `split("\\n")` also preserves
    a trailing newline instead of eating it, which keeps the round trip text-preserving.

    ``None`` when no redirect begins there.

    PORTED AHEAD OF ITS CONSUMER: nothing in `src/` calls this yet, and it is not on
    `guards/api.py`. It is here for a caller that walks command substitutions -- a `$(...)`
    scan of its own -- and the change that adds one is where it acquires a production caller.
    Until then `tests/guards/test_bashscan.py` is what holds its contract, so the contract is
    stated here in full rather than left to be reconstructed from a caller that does not
    exist.

    The need it answers is the one place `scan_heredocs` above deliberately does not look.
    `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'` / body / `EOF` / `)"` puts the whole substitution inside a
    double-quoted string, so `_quoted_spans` reports that `<<'EOF'` as text and no heredoc is
    found -- correct for its own question, since a `<<TAG` inside a string really is not a
    redirect, and the false-open that rule exists to prevent (module docstring) is not
    something to trade away. But bash parses a `$(...)` as a command in its OWN right, and a
    heredoc inside one is a real redirect regardless of the quoting outside it.

    What such a caller needs from that is not the body's text -- it already has it -- but
    where the body ENDS, so it can step over it. A body is DATA to the shell's parser, the
    same rule `scan_heredocs` already states for quote state: an apostrophe in a body opens
    nothing, and a paren in one nests nothing. Without this, a substitution scan's own
    delimiter walk reads the apostrophe in an ordinary English possessive as an unclosed
    quote, swallows the `)` that closed the substitution, and hands its caller a command it
    calls unparseable -- which was measured on the guard this was ported from.

    A REDIRECT WHOSE TERMINATOR LINE IS NOT THERE answers ``None`` -- "nothing to step
    over" -- rather than running to the end of ``text``, and that is the opposite of what
    `scan_heredocs` does with an unterminated body. The asymmetry is the point, and it was
    measured rather than reasoned: a caller of this scans text `prepare` has ALREADY
    stripped, so much the commonest way to reach a `<<TAG` with no terminator is a heredoc
    that was found and removed normally, leaving its header behind (`X=$(bash <<'EOF'` /
    body / `EOF` / `)` strips to `X=$(bash <<'EOF'` / `)`). Running to the end of the text
    there swallows the `)` that closes the substitution and makes the whole command
    unparseable -- a new false denial of exactly the kind this exists to remove, and three
    commands measured it. Not skipping costs nothing: the body's characters are then read as
    ordinary text, which is what such a scan did before this function existed.

    `<<<` (a herestring, which has no body) is excluded by `_HEREDOC`'s own `(?!<)`, and its
    second and third `<` by the same pattern's own lookbehind, so neither is mistaken for a
    redirect here.

    A newline separates two commands in shell exactly as `;` does, but `shlex` with
    `whitespace_split = True` treats it as ordinary whitespace and drops it, so `segments`
    never sees a break and a multi-line command becomes ONE segment. Every argv0-keyed check
    downstream then judges the whole command by its FIRST line's program -- which is how
    `echo hi` + newline + `rm scripts/guard.py` was allowed while the `;` spelling
    of the same command was denied.

    Runs LAST, after `strip_comments` and `scan_heredocs`, both of which are line-based: a
    comment ends at a line break and a heredoc body is delimited by them, so neither can be
    handed text whose newlines have already become separators.

    A newline INSIDE quotes is a literal character of the word, not a separator, and a
    backslash-newline is a line continuation that separates nothing -- both are left exactly
    as they are, so this substitution never invents a command boundary the shell does not
    have.

    The separator is written SPACE-PADDED, and that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
    `shlex`'s `punctuation_chars` mode emits a RUN of adjacent punctuation as ONE token, so a
    bare `;` glued to whatever the previous line ended with produces `;;`, `&;`, `);` or
    `));` -- none of which is in `_SEPARATORS`, so `segments` does not split there and the
    hole this function exists to close stays open. Measured on the proposed module before the
    padding was added: `echo hi;` + newline + `rm scripts/guard.py` tokenized to
    `['echo', 'hi', ';;', 'rm', 'scripts/guard.py']` -- ONE segment, argv0 `echo`,
    allowed. A trailing semicolon is not obfuscation, so the unpadded form would have left a
    one-character variant of the very bypass being fixed.

    `operator_pieces` now decomposes such a run anyway, so the padding is no longer the ONLY
    thing standing there -- and it stays regardless, because the two protections fail
    differently: the padding means a newline separator is never welded in the first place, so
    it survives a future mistake in the operator table (adding `;;` to `_COMPOUND_OPERATORS`,
    say, which is a plausible thing for someone to do since `;;` really is a bash operator,
    would re-fuse exactly this case). Two characters of text for a guarantee that does not

    by a newline -- removed, outside single quotes.

    THE BUG THIS CLOSES: bash joins `\\<newline>` into nothing, both outside quotes and
    inside double quotes (verified with `bash -c`: `cat secrets/\\<newline>.env` reads
    `secrets/.env`; so does the double-quoted form). Before this function existed,
    `_newlines_to_separators` deliberately left such pairs untouched (correctly, for ITS
    OWN job -- see its docstring) and nothing downstream ever removed them, so `tokenize`
    handed `shlex` a token still carrying a literal embedded newline (`secrets/<newline>.env`),
    which `shlex` turns into an escaped-but-not-rejoined token -- not the single joined word
    bash actually reads. Every path-matching check built on `tokenize` inherited the resulting
    hole. Four shapes were measured against a path-matching guard built on these tokens, with
    `TMPDIR` on an empty scratch directory: `cat secrets/\\<newline>.env` (env read),
    `echo x > scripts/\\<newline>guard.py` (boundary write),
    `rm scripts/\\<newline>guard.py` (boundary removal, confirmed executed in a disposable
    tree), and `scripts/\\<newline>sealed.sh TOKEN` (sealed script) all passed it; the removal
    case really did delete the file when run for real.

    QUOTE-AWARE, NOT A NAIVE GLOBAL STRIP -- the direction is load-bearing, not a style
    choice. Inside single quotes bash gives `\\` no special meaning at all: `\\<newline>`
    stays as two literal characters (verified with `od -c`: the backslash AND the newline
    both survive `echo 'secrets/\\<newline>.env'`). A NAIVE strip that removed every
    `\\<newline>` pair regardless of quoting would make the guard see `'secrets/.env'`
    for an argument bash actually reads as `secrets/` + a literal newline + `.env` --
    not a path that exists, and not the one the guard would deny. That is a FALSE DENIAL
    (the naive strip invents a match bash's own argument never contains), which is the
    fail-CLOSED direction a guard must take when its model and bash disagree -- but it
    is still a wrong model of what bash executes, and a wrong model is a liability the
    far side of the ledger has already been burned by (see the module docstring's
    heredoc history). This function stays quote-aware instead: exactly
    as precise as bash itself, so it introduces no new mismatch in either direction on any
    shape measured for this fix -- both the four that must now deny and the false-denial
    probes (a wrapped `docker compose` invocation, a continued `find`, and a heredoc body
    containing a continuation inside single quotes) that must still allow.

    Runs on `scan_heredocs`' OUTPUT, after heredoc extraction and before
    `_newlines_to_separators`, and both placements are load-bearing:

    - AFTER `strip_comments`, never merged into it or run before it. A backslash has no
      special meaning inside a comment (verified: `echo hi # comment \\<newline>rm ...`
      still runs `rm ...` as a separate statement -- the comment ends at the real newline
      regardless of the backslash before it). `strip_comments` already gets this right
      because its comment mode just skips to the next literal `\\n`, ignoring backslashes
      entirely; running continuation-stripping first would glue the "comment" line to the
      next one BEFORE `strip_comments` ever sees a boundary, hiding a real command inside
      what looks like a longer comment -- a false OPEN, and the reverse of what this
      function exists to fix.
    - AFTER `scan_heredocs`, not before it. A quoted-delimiter heredoc body is already
      entirely absent from this text (bash performs no expansion on it at all, so no
      joining happens there either -- confirmed: `<<'EOF'` with a body continuation keeps
      both the backslash and the newline). Running before extraction would have this
      function look for quotes inside heredoc bodies, where a stray apostrophe is a literal
      character, not a real shell quote, and could misjudge a continuation because of it. A
      known, narrower residual of running after extraction: an UNQUOTED heredoc body fed to
      an interpreter is judged from `Heredoc.body`, captured before this function ever
      runs, so a continuation hidden inside such a body is not joined. That body is read --
      `bgcleanup._nested_programs` re-tokenizes a shell-fed one as a command line of its own
      -- so the residual is reachable, and it is recorded rather than closed: joining it
      means continuation-stripping each captured body separately, a second escaping model to
      keep in step with this one, and this module degrades toward reporting LESS about a
      body rather than inventing text no shell would run.
    - BEFORE `_newlines_to_separators`, so no bare `\\<newline>` pair reaches it: every one
      outside single quotes is already gone, and every one still present is inside single
      quotes, which that function's own quote tracking already leaves alone.

    The escaping model matches `_newlines_to_separators`' own (single quotes escape
    nothing; a backslash elsewhere marks exactly the next character as escaped) precisely
    so the two functions never disagree about which side of a quote a character is on. A
    trailing unresolved backslash (nothing follows it) is written back unchanged -- there
    is no next character to decide anything about, so nothing here elides it.
