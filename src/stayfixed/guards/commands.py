    the staged diff in this file**, below a scissors line, and a diff's lines start with `diff`,
    `+`, `-`, `@@` or a space — so the walk back over comment and blank lines stopped at the
    very first one it saw, the whole file read as "message", the attribution block was no longer
    trailing and the hook became a silent no-op. Measured: with `commit.verbose` set, the same
    commit that reports `stripped 2 attribution line(s)` without it stored the trailer intact.
    One config key disabling the whole local layer is worth the extra rule.

    So the scissors line is found first and everything from it down is discarded region; then
    the run of comment and blank lines at the end of what is left is discarded too. The second
    part is the ordinary interactive commit: git's `# Please enter the commit message…` block is
    the file's last paragraph, and `offending_lines`/`strip_message` judge only a message's
    *trailing attribution block* (see `commit.py`'s docstring), which a comment line is not — so
    stripping the file's text whole would no-op on exactly the file the hook is handed.

    `commit.py` must never learn about `#` or about scissors: in a message read from `git log` a
    `#` line is real content, so this split lives here, on the file-reading side. Both rules fail
    the same way, which is the safe way: a message that itself carries a `#` line with `>8` in it
    loses the strip below that point and keeps every byte, a no-op rather than a corruption.
