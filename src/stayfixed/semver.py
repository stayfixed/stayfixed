"""How one version orders against another, read the one way every reader of a version does.

`upgrade` refuses to move a project backward, `doctor`'s `versions` row points by direction, and
`stayfixed gate` admits an upgrade only where `upgrade` would move to it: one comparison, so the
three cannot disagree about which way a recorded version lies. The overlay's `requires` reader
reads a floor through the same component grammar and decides the floor's own triple by
`pre_release`, the reading `later` orders a release after, so a pre-release does not meet the
floor of the release it comes before.

A leaf module: it imports nothing from `stayfixed`.

# Nine ASCII digits a component, and both halves of that bound are load-bearing.
#
# *Bounded*, because `int()` is not total. CPython 3.11 caps integer-string conversion at 4300
# digits, so an unbounded `(\d+)` let a manifest declare `>=999…9.0.0` and made `satisfies`
# raise `ValueError` out of a function whose docstring promises `None` for anything it cannot
# read. `doctor` rendered that as "this check could not run: ValueError", and the session
# handler's `except Exception` swallowed it whole — taking `NOT_ATTACHED` and every other line
# of the same result with it, so an overlay manifest silenced the one line that says the
# project is not attached. Nine digits is past every version anyone releases and far under the
# cap, and the value that exceeds it is now unreadable rather than fatal.
#
# *ASCII*, because `\d` is not. It matches every Unicode decimal digit and `int()` accepts
# them, so a floor spelled in Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals validated, compared as `>=1.0.0`,
# and printed back verbatim into a session line and a `doctor` row — `requires_of` returns the
# overlay's own bytes, and "the one owner-authored string that prints" is meant to be a
# version, not an arbitrary numeral system. `tests/test_semver.py` and
# `tests/overlay/test_requires.py` spell the digits.

    has no leading `X.Y.Z` (`v1.0.0`, an empty string): the direction is unknown, and a caller

    **Equal triples are not equal versions.** Read by the triple alone, `later('1.0.0',

    `+local`, which is later than the bare version — is `None`: this reader orders no suffix it
    does not have to, and a caller refuses rather than guess. A version is never later than
