"""The one seam between stayfixed and the programs it launches.

Everything the areas that launch a program (`overlay`, `attach`, `doctor`, `setup`, and the
release commands) do that leaves this process — asking GitHub for a repository, cloning
one, installing a commit hook — goes through `Runner.launch`, so a test asserts *the argv it would
have run* against a stub instead of shelling out to `gh`, `git` or `pre-commit`. Mocking
`subprocess.run` would hide the argv, which is the only part of these calls that can be wrong in
a way a user notices: a missing `--private` publishes somebody's private overlay.

A missing binary is a finding, never a traceback: stayfixed installs none of `gh`, `git` and
`pre-commit`, and has to report on a machine that lacks any of them. So an `OSError` from the launch
becomes `Completed(NOT_FOUND, ...)` and the caller turns it into a note. A binary that ran and never
returned gets its own code, `TIMED_OUT`, because "not installed" and "hung for five minutes" are
different findings.

# The shell's own code for "command not found", used here for a binary that could not be
# launched at all, so a caller has one number to read rather than an exception to catch.
NOT_FOUND = 127
# `timeout(1)`'s own code, and a separate one on purpose. `TimeoutExpired` is a
# `SubprocessError`, so a `gh` that hung for the full `NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` used to arrive
# as `NOT_FOUND` -- which every caller reads as "gh is not installed". A wrong finding is worse
# than a slow one, and the two states have different remedies.
TIMED_OUT = 124
# Wall-clock bound on one call: a named cap (CONTRIBUTING.md#named-caps), and no shipped file
# changes with it. Deliberately far wider than `gitenv.GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, which bounds a local,
# argument-free query that neither touches the network nor grows with the repository; every call
# here does the opposite — `gh repo create --clone` waits on GitHub to generate a repository from a
# template, and the clone that follows comes down the wire. Tune this for a hung process, not for a
# slow link.
NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300
# Inherit the environment rather than scrub it: these are the machine owner's own authenticated
# commands, and `gh` needs its token and `git` its ssh-agent to work at all. What is dropped is
# what points git at a *different* repository, or a different index or object store, than the
# directory it was given -- which is exactly what a clone into a fresh directory must not
# inherit. `gitenv.scrubbed_env()` reaches the same end from the other side, with a five-key
# allowlist; this seam cannot, because the owner's own authentication is the point of it.
#
# **This list is a trade-off and is not exhaustive, and the comment that said it was the two
# that redirect git was wrong.** `GH_HOST` and `GH_CONFIG_DIR` redirect `gh` the same way and
# are kept deliberately: they are how a GitHub Enterprise owner reaches their own host, and
# dropping them would break that installation outright to close a gap the inherited token does
# not have. A caller that needs them gone should say which call and why.
#
# `GH_FORCE_TTY` and `CLICOLOR_FORCE` are dropped for the reason `_ENV_FORCE` below exists: every
# call here captures its output, so terminal behaviour is never wanted, and either one makes `gh`
# colour its JSON (measured with gh 2.101.0: `gh api` and `gh repo view --json` start with an
# escape sequence), which every caller that parses it then reads as no answer. `NO_COLOR` and
# `CLICOLOR=0` do not undo either, so the variables go rather than a third one being added.

# invisible and blocks for the whole of `NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, which a caller cannot tell
# from a hang. What makes that a finding rather than an annoyance is which callers reach the
# network through here: `setup --overlay create:` launches `gh repo create` and a clone, whose
# authentication is the machine owner's and which prompts when it is missing, and
# `release.pins.released` runs `git ls-remote` against the public repository for `stayfixed init`
# and for `doctor`'s `ci-ref` row -- a write meant to run non-interactively and a read-only
# diagnostic, neither of them something a person is sitting in front of waiting to type a
# password.
#
# **This used to say the `ci-ref` row resolves a repository-authored URL, and it does not.** That
# row has asked about `stayfixed.REPOSITORY_URL`, a module constant, ever since that constant was
# introduced. The control is unchanged and still needed; what was wrong was the sentence explaining
# it, which named the one caller it had stopped applying to -- and a false rationale on a hardening

# tag lines, `gh`'s JSON), or ignores it for an exit code — and on none of them comparing it
# with a path or opening one, which is what `gitenv.git_run`'s lossless reading is for. Read
# strictly, one such byte would end the command as an internal error — `test attribute` over a
