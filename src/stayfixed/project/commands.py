"""The project area's commands: `init` writes a repository's stayfixed scaffold once, `upgrade`
refreshes it, and `uninstall` takes it back.

**The summary is both rendered reports, the way `overlay upgrade`'s is.** It was four lines of
counts, with every artifact's verb and the whole REFUSED section reachable only under `--json`
— so the skill that tells a relayer to pass on "both reports" and "every refused line" was
describing output the command did not print, and the exit-1 path is the one a person meets
without a flag. `scaffold.render_report` is the renderer, and the same text goes into `--json`
under `once` and `scaffold`, so the two cannot disagree.

That is safe on the repository-bytes rule because `render_report` bounds every target it
prints: one outside `PATH_VALUE`, such as a target a committed manifest recorded, prints as its
artifact id. The reason beside it is the engine's own fixed vocabulary. The CI line is one of
this area's fixed sentences, or a tag and a commit the *release* area resolved from the public
repository's own tags. The project's name and its `[ci]` values reach none of them.

**The workflow is claimed only when nothing skipped it, and the ref it names is the one on
disk.** `_ci` reaches its branch-grammar check *after* the pin has resolved, so a repository with
a resolved tag and a `gate_branch` outside the grammar has a pin and no workflow; keying the CI
line on the pin told that repository `CI: <tag>@<sha>` while `skipped["ci-workflow"]` said the
opposite in `--json`. The key in `skipped` is the authority — `_ci` returns a template or a
reason and never both — and `report.ref` is the second half: on the adoption path the workflow
pins the ref `stayfixed.toml` already carried rather than one this run resolved, so the line says
that instead of naming a release the file does not record.

**Exit 1 on a refusal, not 2.** A refused artifact is a finding the report names, and `apply`
was never reached: nothing was written, there is no manifest, and re-running after the fix is
the whole remedy. That is `overlay upgrade`'s rule, and this command follows it so a caller
scripting over both reads one number. Exit 2 stays what it is everywhere — a refusal raised
above the plans, such as a missing `--yes` or a repository that is already initialised.
