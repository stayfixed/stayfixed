"""What `init --yes` can read off a repository without asking, and where each value came from.

Four values, each one `git` question or a probe of the root: the name, the base branch, the
harnesses whose directories the root carries, and the shipped profile whose markers it
carries. `origin_remote` is `gitenv`'s, so "what is this checkout's origin" is asked one way
wherever it is asked.

**Three of them are repository-authored strings, and each is held to a grammar before it is
returned:** the remote's last path segment and the checkout's directory name to `[project]
name`'s, and `origin/HEAD`'s branch — or, in a repository with no remote at all, the branch
checked out — to the one a rendered workflow accepts. A name outside its grammar is
refused naming the grammar and never the value, or, leniently, returned as `""` and `not
derivable`, so `init --questions` asks for it rather than suggesting it. A branch outside its
grammar is reported as the default.
The agents and the profile are names from stayfixed's own registries.

Each value also says where it came from, in one of this module's fixed phrases, because a
default is only as good as its source: `origin/HEAD` is set by `git clone`, `git remote
set-head`, or a `git fetch` from git 2.48 on that finds none, and goes stale after the remote's
default branch is renamed, since git does not refresh one it has.
