"""Refuse a write or removal git would never show, at a place a committed `[paths]` value chose:
one guard for `init`, `upgrade` and `uninstall`.

A managed region is inserted into whatever file its `[paths]` key names, recorded or not, and a
whole file is overwritten or removed while its bytes are the ones a record states. Both the
`[paths]` value and the record are committed, and the promise that makes that acceptable is that
the diff shows the result. For a file git ignores it does not: a pulled commit setting
`agents_md = ".env"` had `upgrade` report `region_update .env (refreshed)` and append the region
to a git-ignored `.env`, and `git status` showed only the manifest. With a record carrying the
digest of a predictable ignored file (a tool-generated marker), the same commit had `uninstall`
delete it or `upgrade` overwrite it. Nothing git ignores can be given back by git either.

**The rule is exactly three conditions, and a planned write or removal is refused only when all
three hold.** Its file exists: creating a file changes nothing that was there, and removing one that
is not there removes nothing. Git ignores it. And its place was chosen by a `[paths]` value, that
is, it is not a place this build could put that artifact under the preset's own paths
(`_preset_places`), asked of that artifact's id and no other's. A fixed name (`CLAUDE.md`,
`stayfixed.toml`, `.gitignore`, the workflow, a harness's rule) and a preset-default place are never
refused: no repository value chose them, and a person may well keep `CLAUDE.md` in a global excludes
file or `stayfixed.toml` in `.git/info/exclude` on purpose. A first version refused every ignored
target, which refused those setups outright and left `uninstall` no way to take back a `CLAUDE.md`
stayfixed wrote there. The retirement a record can steer only ever reaches a target `could_write`
lists, and those beyond the preset's are `[paths]` values, so the `.env` case and the forged-record
case stay refused.

**What anchors "the preset's place", and what a repository can move.** The places are
stayfixed's own: the `[defaults.paths]` of a preset this build ships, fed through this build's
`project_templates`, whose `could_write` lists every target it could produce for each id. The
one repository input is `[stayfixed] preset`, and `presets.load_preset` accepts only a preset this
build ships, so a clone can choose among stayfixed's anchors and cannot author one. Nothing on
the disk is read to compute them, so a path this configuration never uses cannot refuse the run
(a symlinked `docs/` under `[paths]` values that all live elsewhere did, through the trail's
`contained()`), and they are computed only once some target qualifies.

One `git check-ignore`, before anything is written, dry run included; the refusal names each file
through `scaffold.printable`, the bound every report prints targets through.

**Ignored means what git would hide.** `check-ignore` consults the index, so a tracked file that
happens to match an ignore pattern is not ignored here: git shows every change to it. That is why
this is not `--no-index`, which `docs.trail` and `memory.refs` use to ask about patterns alone.

**`LOCAL_ARTIFACTS` is exempt**: `[artifacts] local` asks for exactly that directory, which the
footprint's ignore block keeps out of git on purpose.

**No repository, no guard.** Outside a git work tree there is no diff for a change to hide
from, and every write still goes through `contained()` and the `O_NOFOLLOW` walk. Inside one, a
`check-ignore` that answers neither "some matched" nor "none matched" refuses the run before any
write (`DECLINED`), dry run included, because a guard that cannot answer must not read as a pass,
and a repository can choose either way of not answering. git reads every `.gitignore` along each
path it is asked about, so a commit holding a deep path under large `.gitignore` files runs it
past `git_run`'s bound (`-1`, no answer), and git answers a batch holding a path inside a
submodule with exit 128; a no-answer that was only a note let a pulled commit write past the guard
to a git-ignored `.env`. A `git` slow under load or not installed is refused the same way, and
the refusal says to run the command again. Whether this is a work tree at all is read off the disk
(`gitenv.in_work_tree`) and never asked of the same `git`, which fails the same way under the same
load: a `rev-parse` that timed out beside the `check-ignore` read as "no repository" and let the
write through with nothing said.
