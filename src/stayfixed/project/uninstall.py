"""`stayfixed uninstall`: `upgrade`'s rule run backwards.

Every artifact the manifest records is retired: one this build still produces with its own
template, one it no longer produces at a recorded target `Prepared.could_write` lists for its id,
whatever `[ci] mode` says now. `[artifacts] local` artifacts are never recorded and are retired by
id. The engine then removes a whole file while its bytes are stayfixed's, takes a region out of a
file (and the file, if nothing else was in it), and leaves anything else in place and listed.
`--force PATH` takes a listed file anyway. Records naming an id this build does not produce, or a
target it could not have written, are counted and never touched.

**A region leaves as a region.** A record this build no longer produces is judged against a
whole-file stub, which names no region, so `retired_templates` never retires a record whose kind
says it lived inside a host file: it is counted as an orphan, by the one rule `upgrade` applies
too. A region comes out only through the template this build produces for it.

**What anchors a removal, and what a commit can move.** Which artifact ids exist, which targets
each could have, and every region's name are this build's: constants in the installed package
that no repository can extend. The `[paths]` value a target is built from, and the digest a record
carries, come from committed files. So a commit can have this command remove only a whole file
whose exact bytes the same commit records, or the region a template of this build names, and its
diff shows the `[paths]` edit and the record. The kind a record carries is committed too, and all
it can do here is turn a removal into an orphan. Nothing committed reaches `.git/` or
`.stayfixed/`: the loader refuses a `[paths]` value inside either, and the manifest is read through
`contained()`, so a symlinked `.stayfixed/` is a refusal. Nor is a file git ignores at a place a
`[paths]` value chose: `ignored.refuse_ignored` refuses the run before any write when git ignores
an existing file there that a plan would remove or rewrite, `.stayfixed/local/artifacts/` excepted,
and says to take the key out, after which the file is left and listed. That is the whole
boundary, and why `docs/cli.md` says to run it on a checkout you trust.

**Two passes, footprint first.** `AGENTS.md` holds the write-once skeleton and the footprint's
`harness` region. Once the region is out, an untouched skeleton is byte-identical to the one
recorded, and the write-once pass removes it. The dry run judges the skeleton with its region still
in, and `ORDER_NOTE` says so. `--force` never reaches the write-once pass at a path the footprint
pass also targets: forcing `AGENTS.md` forces stayfixed's region out of it, and the skeleton, with
whatever a person wrote into it, is then judged on its own bytes.

**The ignore region last, and only over nothing.** The footprint's `.gitignore` region is the
only thing keeping `.stayfixed/local/` out of git, so it is taken out in a third pass, after the
disk shows nothing left under `.stayfixed/local/`. If something is left, the run stops before that
pass, with the region and the manifest in place, so git still ignores the files, and once they
are moved out the next run can finish (`KEPT_AFTER`).

**Directories as each pass goes, then `stayfixed.toml`, then the ledger.** Every directory above
a file a pass removed goes once it is empty, when the pass ends or stops (`_apply`), and no other:
a `[paths]` value is committed, so a directory it merely names may be a person's. Then
`stayfixed.toml`, whose removal the write-once pass holds back for this point, then
`.stayfixed/assessment.json`, the manifest, and `.stayfixed/` once it is empty. So a run stopped at
any earlier point leaves the configuration and the manifest the next run needs to finish it. A
process killed mid-pass can leave an empty directory behind, which no later run removes.

**Two refusals come before any write**: while the repository is attached, and while
`.stayfixed/local/` holds a file this run would not remove, the local-only memory notes above all.
That count is a prediction from the plans: a file goes only when an action unlinks it, or when
a region's removal leaves exactly what the write-once pass then removes, which the engine's own
rule for a file kept out of git (`ours_locally`, asked of each file `local_copies` names) answers
before anything is written. An edited region, or a skeleton a person wrote into that shares the
region's file, keeps the file, so the run refuses before it writes rather than part-way. The check
above stays as the fact behind the prediction. It counts and never names a path, and a dry run
reports it instead of refusing, even when a plan refuses, so the report that lists an edited
local artifact is still printed.

**The engine's ledger of what it wrote under `.stayfixed/local/artifacts/`** (`LOCAL_DIGESTS`) is
stayfixed's own and is never counted. It goes after the write-once pass, once nothing else is left
under `.stayfixed/local/`, and before the ignore block. Every artifact it records is judged, so a
copy left behind when its id left `[artifacts] local` goes while its bytes are stayfixed's, and is
listed `skip_modified` otherwise, where `--force` with its path reaches it.

**A refusal while writing is not a refusal before it.** The engine keeps what it applied, and
records it, when a later write or removal fails; so does this command across its passes. Exit 2
then means "stopped part-way": what was done is on disk and in the manifest, and running the
command again re-plans from there to the end. `stayfixed.toml` is still there, since it goes last,
unless the last pass removed it and then could not write the manifest; that state is the next
paragraph's, and restoring the file finishes it.

**Without `stayfixed.toml`, nothing can be judged.** While the manifest still records the file
(`CONFIG_ARTIFACT`), either something other than this command took it, a person deleting it above
all, or a run of this command removed it inside `apply` and then never wrote the manifest: it was
killed in between, or the manifest write itself failed (`Manifest.write` raising in `apply`'s
`finally`). `apply` otherwise drops the record with the file, and writes the manifest even when a
later action refuses. Going on would drop the manifest and leave every recorded file untracked for
good, so the run refuses before any write and says to restore the file (`DELETED_CONFIG`), which is
the remedy in both cases: a restored file is judged like any other, and the next run converges. With
no such record, either a run stopped after removing it and before the manifest, or the file was the
project's own and never recorded; then the ledger goes, every recorded file stays, and the note
gives their count, so the next run converges instead of refusing for ever. No directory is pruned on
that path: nothing says where this configuration put its artifacts, and a target the manifest
records is a committed string.
