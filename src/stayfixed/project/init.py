"""`stayfixed init --yes`: the footprint, written by the engine in two passes.

The three write-once files are `Kind.ONCE` artifacts in a pass of their own and the rest of the
footprint is the second, because two artifacts cannot target one file in one pass. Both are
planned before either is applied, so a refusal anywhere leaves nothing written and no
manifest; the dry run reports both plans and writes nothing.

A repository that already holds a `stayfixed.toml` and no manifest is adopted. One that holds a
manifest is refused: re-running `init` is `stayfixed upgrade`.

**The workflow and `[ci] ref` are one value.** A resolved pin is written into the document
only when this run is the one that creates it, and `templates._ci` renders the workflow from
`config.ci.ref` — so the `uses:` ref and what `stayfixed.toml` says on disk cannot come apart.
`doctor`'s `ci-ref` row reports red when they do, which is why this is the invariant rather than
a convenience.

**Adopted means read, not replaced.** `stayfixed.toml` is a `Kind.ONCE` artifact: created when
absent, never looked inside again. So on a repository that already carries one the engine
reports `skip_modified` — "create-once, and the file is already there" — and the file comes
back byte for byte but for one key. What the hand-written document does is decide the whole
run: it is parsed, merged under stayfixed's own two keys and the preset's defaults, and
validated by `loads` before a byte is written, and the `Config` that comes out is what every
target below is built from.

**The one key is a missing `[stayfixed] version`**, the only tool-owned key the loader
requires, with its `[stayfixed]` header when the file has none. It is added through
`config.owned.rewrite`, which keeps every other line, and the file is checked with `loads` as it
will then be on disk — before any network call and any write, dry run included — because the
merged document forces `state`, drops `enforced` and detects a name the file may lack, and so
loads where the next command's `load` would not. The other tool-owned keys are written only into
a file stayfixed itself creates, which is the only file whose header claims them.

**Every value in the document this writes is stayfixed's own, the repository's own answer read
back, or an answer a person gave as a flag.** The tool-owned keys are `config.owned.OWNED`;
everything else is copied from a `stayfixed.toml` a person wrote, or — where there is none —
taken from the answers `Given` carries, each held by the parser to its grammar or its choices,
or detected under `PROJECT_NAME`'s grammar, which is the one thing `detect` refuses outside of.
Answers never reach a document a person wrote: `precheck` refuses them over one. `loads` then
validates the whole document before a byte is written, so a bad path or a bad name costs the
run rather than the repository.
