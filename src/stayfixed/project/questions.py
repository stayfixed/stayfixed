"""What `stayfixed init` would ask, as a JSON Schema: `stayfixed init --questions`.

Ten questions, each keyed by the `stayfixed.toml` key its answer writes, but the last, `plugins`,
which `stayfixed setup` answers on the machine rather than in the repository. Each carries the
value `stayfixed init --yes` takes when it is not answered, where that value came from, the flag
that answers it, and four lines (`TRADE_OFFS`): what the answer gives, what it gives up, what it
leaves behind and how to take it back. The texts are the command's, so the `init` skill relays
them rather than writing its own. The schema is modelled on MCP elicitation's flat form schema, so
a client that drops `pattern` and the `x-stayfixed-*` keys can send it as a requested schema; an
agent harness's ask tool takes questions and options instead, so the `init` skill turns the
properties into questions: taking every default first, then the name and the base branch as one
confirmation, then the rest one at a time, in `PROPERTIES`' order, within each harness's limits.

**Nothing here carries a byte a grammar rejected.** Every default comes from `detect`, which
bounds the three repository-authored strings before it returns them, from stayfixed's own
registries, or from the preset. A name outside `[project] name`'s grammar has no default at all:
it is asked, never suggested. The machine file changes one option's title and nothing else.
