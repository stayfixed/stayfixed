"""The project footprint as `Template`s, built from a configuration.

Under the module root beside `templates/overlay/` and resolved by `stayfixed.templates.tree`, the
one resolver both shipped trees go through. The three write-once files are `Kind.ONCE`
artifacts in a pass of their own, because two artifacts cannot target one file in one pass;
everything else is the footprint pass. Every target is a `config.paths` value, which the
loader has bounded to `PATH_VALUE` and contained; what this module adds is a file name under
it. A value that reaches a rendered file (`gate_branch` and `ref` into YAML) is quoted or
shape-checked there — `BRANCH_NAME`, `CI_REF` — and a value outside its grammar costs the
artifact rather than the run.

This module builds templates and decides nothing about a manifest. Which recorded artifacts a
configuration retires, what `[artifacts] local` may not move out of git, and the order of the
footprint pass are the lifecycle policy `init`, `upgrade` and `uninstall` apply to what it
builds, and they are `project.footprint`'s.

**Every write-once file this renders answers to the configuration, including the two that look
like fixed text.** `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line pointer and its one line is `[paths] agents_md`: it
was the literal `@AGENTS.md`, so a project that renamed the instruction file got a pointer at a
file that was not there and a `docs check` that passed anyway, and every session in it followed
the dangling pointer. The skeleton's budget sentence is the same shape — it states the numbers
`stayfixed docs check` enforces, so it is filled from `Budgets.effective` rather than from three
literals copied out of the preset.

**One invariant governs the workflow: its `uses:` ref is always what `[ci] ref` says on disk
after the run.** That is what `doctor`'s `ci-ref` row enforces from the other side — "the
workflow pins a different ref from `[ci] ref`, so the gate that runs is not the one recorded" —
and it is why the workflow is rendered from `config.ci.ref` and never from the resolution
directly. `init` writes a resolved pin into the document only when it is the run that creates
the document, so on the adoption path `config.ci.ref` is the repository's own recorded value and
the workflow pins that; where the adopted document records none, no workflow is written at all.

    """Which artifacts this build is built to write each place: the one relation both rules that
    ask "whose file is this?" read, so they cannot come apart.

    **The relation.** `could_write` is `Prepared.could_write`: for each artifact id, every target
    this build could produce for it under any configuration — this run's templates, the workflow
    whatever `[ci] mode` says, every shipped profile's rules and each harness's rendition of them.
    A place is `foreign` to an id when another id is built to write it. Which ids exist and where
    each could write are this build's; the `[paths]` values those places are built from are
    committed, and all a value can do here is add a place, never take one away. Places are one
    file when `fsops.path_key` says so, as on the default filesystems of macOS and Windows, so
    `roadmap = "claude.md"` is `CLAUDE.md`'s file on every filesystem and every rule below reddens
    on Linux as on macOS.

    **The one exception is `SHARED_FILE`**, and it is how the build is made: the `AGENTS.md`
    skeleton, written once, and the region every later run refreshes inside it, both built from
    `[paths] agents_md`, share a file by design, which is the reason there are two passes. Nothing
    a repository writes makes another pair: a place two other ids reach because committed values
    coincide is foreign to both.

    **The collision refusal** (`_no_file_of_another`) refuses a template at a place foreign to its
    id, in either pass, before anything is planned. Within one pass: `scaffold.engine.plan` has no
    duplicate-target detection, so with `roadmap` and `roadmap_history` set to one path both plans
    reported zero refusals, `apply` wrote both, the file held only the second artifact's bytes and
    the manifest recorded two different digests for one path — the roadmap's trail block lost,
    one record read as hand-edited for ever, and `uninstall` removing a file that held the other
    artifact; `agents_md = "CLAUDE.md"` collides the same way in the write-once pass. Across the
    passes, and against a file only another configuration builds (another profile's rules, a
    harness's rule this project does not list, the workflow), because that is the same collision
    a run later. The anchor is this module's artifact list, a constant in the installed package;
    the refusal names two ids and their `[paths]` keys so that the remedy is one edit, and never
    the value, which is the repository's bytes.

    **The ledger rule** (`scaffold.engine.left_copies`): an entry of the ledger of files kept out
    of git (`scaffold.local.LocalDigests`) under one id never names a place there foreign to that
    id, which is another artifact's copy, judged under its own id or not at all. The ledger is
    kept out of git and a clone can force-add it anyway. Without the rule, an entry under
    `roadmap` naming the `CLAUDE.md` stayfixed had kept out of git, stamped with the digest of those
    unedited and so predictable bytes, had `upgrade` remove that copy as the roadmap's relocated
    one: `upgrade` plans only the footprint pass, so no template of its plan claimed the file, and
    nothing ever wrote it again. An exception taken from coinciding `[paths]` values instead of
    from `SHARED_FILE` handed `roadmap` that place as soon as `roadmap = "CLAUDE.md"` was committed
    beside the entry; the collision refusal stops that configuration first, and the relation
    withholds the place from both ids anyway. An artifact's own earlier places are in nobody's
    list (a `[paths]` value that moved is a place this configuration no longer builds), so a copy
    it left there is still judged.

    asked about paths no run will use, which `ignored._preset_places` does with the preset's.

    `adopted` says whether this run read a `stayfixed.toml` it did not write, and it is threaded
    rather than derived: `_ci` cannot tell the two kinds of run apart from a `Config` and a
    `Resolution`, and every sentence it can print about a missing `[ci] ref` is wrong for one of
