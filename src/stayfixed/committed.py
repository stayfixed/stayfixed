"""A document as one commit holds it at the project's own path, read the one way every reader
of a commit's copy reads it.

Two readers ask: `stayfixed gate` for the base's `stayfixed.toml`, which governs the run, and the
ledger's base comparison for the `stayfixed.toml` of each commit a change forked from, which says
where that commit kept its ledger. Each answer decides what a pull request is judged against, so
each is read at the project root's path inside the repository as git spells it, with the
pathspec literal and from the repository's top, and a root whose path git and the caller spell
differently is refused rather than guessed at (`repository_prefix`). Read any other way, a
change could make the path empty — a symlinked root, a directory named like pathspec magic —
and pass as the change that adds the configuration.
