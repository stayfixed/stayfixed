"""The binding's row in `stayfixed doctor`: the delivery and the memory pointer.

`attached` is this area's: it reads the attach ledger this area writes, asks this machine, through
this area's own `read_binding`, whether a binding stands behind it, and then reads what the binding
delivers: the render `attach` left under the machine's data directory, the paths it placed in the
main checkout, and the `autoMemoryDirectory` key there. Every checkout of a repository reads the
main checkout's ledger and settings file, since `attach` writes there alone. `doctor`'s core
discovers this module by name (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Areas") and imports nothing of this area.

The overlay root is the core's answer, `Context.overlay_root`, resolved at most once per report
for every row that reads it. The attach ledger comes from the `_Ledger` this module's `register()`
creates, one per report, so every question the row asks of the file gets one answer.

Every import sits inside a function body, as in a `hooks.py`: this module is imported by
discovery, and a module-level import here would be one more thing every `doctor` run loads
before it has asked anything.

    Three different situations are three answers and never one `None` — a ledger naming a store
    the overlay does not permit, a machine that records no overlay at all, and a machine with no
    usable `git` — because collapsed, the `attached` row would read the last two as *attached*.
    They are not one finding. A ledger whose store is not this project's share of the recorded
    overlay is a fact about **this repository**, and `.stayfixed/local/attach.json` is a path a
    clone can commit, so it earns a warning. A missing overlay or a missing `git` is a fact about
    **our own inputs**, and a row that accused the repository on it would be reporting on itself.
    So is a machine file that could not be read (`MACHINE_UNREAD`), asked first as `NO_OVERLAY` is:
    `read_binding` would raise its refusal as a `Failure`, read as `UNASKABLE`, which blames `git`.

    The three are told apart without restructuring `read_binding`, which raises `Refusal` for
    two of them: `context.overlay_root` is the answer of the same `overlay_root(machine)` that
    function calls with the same argument, so asking it first takes the overlay-is-missing arm
    off the table, and what is left of `Refusal` is the store that is not this project's
    permitted root. Anything else that goes wrong — a `git` that cannot be asked, a ledger this
    process may not read — answers `UNASKABLE`, which is the conservative
    direction: it never accuses the repository for something it may not have done.
