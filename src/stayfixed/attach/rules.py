"""The overlay's rules: standing ones for every session, path-scoped ones once per file per session.

**Where they live.** `<overlay>/common/claude/rules/*.md` and
`<overlay>/projects/<project>/claude/rules/*.md`, beside the overlay's `permissions.json` and
`hooks.json`. A rule whose frontmatter has a `paths:` key is path-scoped; any other is a standing
rule. Common rules come first and the project's second, each in name order, and a project rule
replaces the common rule of the same file name, as a project's skill does in the render.

**For the bound project only.** `<project>` is the one this machine's binding record names for the
checkout's id (`stayfixed.binding.bound_project`), never a name the repository supplies, so a clone
that names one of the owner's projects in its `stayfixed.toml` hears no rule. The overlay is the one
the machine file records.

**How they reach a session.** A standing rule, through the core plugin's `SessionStart`, on every
event that matcher covers, since a compacted or cleared context has lost it. A path-scoped rule,
through the `PostToolUse` entry the rendered plugin carries only when the overlay holds one
(`attach.render`): on a `Read`, `Edit` or `Write` of a file one of its `paths:` globs matches,
relative to the checkout's root, once per file per session. The globs are `*` and `?` within one
path segment, `**` across segments and `{a,b}` for alternatives, matched against the whole path.

**The once-per-file record** is an empty file under `<data>/sessions/`, named by the session id and
the file's absolute path, each hashed to a fixed width, since both come off a hook's stdin. A
payload with no session id keeps no record, so its rules are said on every read rather than
silenced under a name anything could lay down in advance; and a record that cannot be written costs
the same, never the rule.

**What reaches the model.** A rule's body is the owner's, delivered as they wrote it, like an
overlay note; the one path printed is the file the agent touched, through `printed.printable`.
