"""The attach area's import surface: everything another area may import from it.

The list is chosen from what consumers outside this area actually reach for, and every name on
it carries the reason beside it — a surface that survives a trim with no explanation is what
made the trim necessary. An area that needs something absent from this list grows it
deliberately, in a commit that says which area and why — it does not import a private module of
this area.

No module under `src/` outside this area imports from here. `doctor` was the one consuming area,
and its `attached` row and the claims `hook-entries` reads are now this area's own
(`attach/doctor.py`), which reaches this area's modules directly. What is left is what the suite
reads from outside the area:

- the ledger (`ledger`) and `AttachLedger`, because `ledger` returns it: a return
  type absent from this list is a value a consumer can hold and cannot declare, and
  `tests/test_surfaces.py` derives that rule rather than restating it;
- the binding (`read_binding`, `Binding`). `Binding.state` is one of `memory.api`'s
  `BINDING_STATES`: the vocabulary and the one classifier that decides between its members are
  the memory area's, so this area publishes neither a copy of the set nor its own members;
- the file the overlay's granted hook entries live in (`LOCAL_SETTINGS`), which the doctor area's
  tests write those entries into.

**Trimmed when the `attached` row moved into this area: `overlay_entries`.** It was published for
`doctor`'s provenance column, which this area's `doctor.py` now answers.

**`setup` is not a consumer.** This docstring used to say "`setup` runs `attach --check` and
reads the same `Result`"; `src/stayfixed/setup/` imports nothing from `stayfixed.attach`, and
`attach --check` is this area's own command module calling its own `attach.check`. The
permission-diff half of the area — `check`, `diff_permissions` and the `PermissionDiff` it
returns — was published on the strength of that sentence and left when the sentence did.

**Trimmed: `attach`, `detach`, `Attached` and `Detached`.** They were published against a
second sentence of the same kind — "`tests/test_install_path.py`, the walkthrough that runs the
four packages in the order a person does, is the other consumer, and it drives `attach` and
`detach`, whose returns are `Attached` and `Detached`". That walkthrough drives the argument
parser: `step("attach", "--store", ..., "--yes", ...)`, which is the point of it, because the
commands' argv wiring is what it exists to exercise. It imports two surfaces,
`stayfixed.doctor.api` and `stayfixed.memory.api`, and reaches no name on this list. The two verbs
are this area's own command module's, and their results are read where they are returned.

The claim is the same shape as the one this docstring corrected two paragraphs up, and as the
one `setup/api.py` corrected about its own `setup` and `SetupReport` — three of them now, all
naming a test that runs a command rather than a module that imports a name. A published surface
argued from prose is a surface nobody measured: the first count of this list's importers
covered `src/`, `scripts/` and `tests/` and never read the sentence, and the sentence is what
kept the names.

The ledger's path and the `.gitignore` block `init` and `attach` both write are the core's
(`config.layout`'s `ATTACH_LEDGER` and `IGNORE_BODY`), because `project` and `doctor` name them
too and the core may not import this area; the crossings still pinned are listed in
`tests/boundaries/test_delivery.py`.
