"""What a session hears about the overlay it is bound to, or not bound to, and the overlay's rules.

`overlay-rules` and `overlay-path-rules` deliver the overlay's rules (`attach.rules`): the standing
ones on every `SessionStart`, and a path-scoped one on the `PostToolUse` the rendered plugin's
entry sends for a `Read`, `Edit` or `Write`. Both answer from the machine's binding record, never
from the repository's configuration, and say nothing for an unbound checkout. The rest of this
docstring is about `overlay-status`.

This area registers it because the question is this area's: `binding_for` says whether a
repository is bound.

Every line is fixed text with at most a count interpolated, but two: the overlay's declared floor
is the one owner-authored string that prints, normalised the way it was validated, and a bound
checkout whose `origin` moved hears both remotes, each through `printed.quoted`
(`memory.store.origin_note`). A repository chooses `project.name`, `memory.groups` and
`paths.memory`, and none of the three appears here — a repository is untrusted input (principle
5), which is also why
`memory.store.refusal_reason` is not used: its text is built out of those same fields.

**At most once per session (`once_key`), and what it actually costs.** The matcher fires on
`startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` and `fork`, inside an entry whose `timeout` is ten
seconds.

`hooks/dispatch.py` banks a `once_key` only for a result with a context, so the marker is laid
down exactly when this handler had something to say. A session that hears a line hears it once;
a **healthy** repository -- bound, pushed, satisfied -- returns an empty result, banks
nothing, and is asked again on every one of those events.

And it is the healthy path that pays for the `git`, which is the opposite of what this docstring
said for three rounds. `binding_for` asks `origin_remote` on every run, at `gitenv`'s five-second
cap; `overlay_sync`'s `git status` and `git rev-list` are two seconds each and sit under `if not
lines:`, so they are reached exactly when nothing above them found anything wrong. Nine seconds
against the entry's ten, on the repository with nothing to report. The skip is real but it is
the other way round: a repository with a finding pays five seconds and not nine, because the
finding short-circuits the sync.

**So the sync is gated here, per context, rather than by changing what `once_key` means.**
`CONTINUED` says which invocations are one context asking again: on a `compact` the two extra
`git` calls are not paid and the handler answers on what the lines above already know, so a
healthy repository costs five seconds there instead of nine. Every other `source` pays --
`startup`, `resume`, `fork`, `clear`, and a payload carrying none -- so an invocation this module
cannot place in a context is treated as a new one and the nudge is never lost by default.

`resume` was in the set, and it is the case the nudge exists for. `claude --resume` and
`--continue` are a fresh launch of the harness, often days after the conversation they continue:
notes written to the overlay in that conversation are exactly what is uncommitted or unpushed by
then, and a `startup` that found the repository healthy banked no marker to say otherwise. A
`compact` is the same running process asking again within minutes, and it stays gated.
`dispatch.py`'s `once_key` semantics belong to every area's handlers and are untouched; the
five-second `origin_remote` is not gated either, because it is what decides the moved-`origin`
line above, and skipping it would drop that line rather than defer it.

The cost, stated rather than hidden: an overlay that becomes unpushed *during* a session whose
`startup` found nothing to say is not reported on that session's later `compact`; the next
`resume` or `startup` reports it.
`stayfixed doctor` answers on demand, and the alternative is a pair of `git` calls re-run on every
compaction of a repository with nothing wrong with it.

Every import below the vocabulary is inside the handler body: `tests/boundaries/test_discovery.py`
asserts that discovery in a clean interpreter leaves `stayfixed.config`, `stayfixed.presets` and
`stayfixed.release` out of `sys.modules`.

# `SessionStart.source` values that are one context asking again, and the only thing this module
# reads the payload for.
#
# **What the gate rests on, and how much of it is established.** The `once_key` marker is filed
# under the session id -- `hooks/commands.py` builds the sink from `event.session_id` -- so "this
# context has already been asked" is true exactly when the invocation carries the id the marker was
# filed under. `compact` is in the set because it names the running harness continuing one
# conversation; `startup` and `fork` begin one and are out of it; `resume` is out of it because it
# is a new launch, often days later, over an overlay the conversation it continues may have left
# dirty; `clear` is out of it because a fresh conversation may carry a session id this handler has
# never answered for.
#
# **Those last two are assumptions about the harness, and this repository establishes neither.**
# `session_id` is read and passed through untouched (`hooks/dispatch.py` types it `str | None` and
# interprets nothing), no fixture here drives a real `/clear` or a real resume, and no field
# documented to this code says how ids are allocated. What they cost if they are wrong is not
# symmetric, which is why the set is drawn this way: if a `compact` arrived under a *new* id, the
# gate would skip the sync for a context that had never been asked and would lose the nudge; if a
# `clear` or a `resume` keeps the id, the whole cost is two `git` calls re-paid. So the set
# is as small as the saving allows, and a value not in it -- including a payload with no `source` at
# all -- pays: losing four seconds is recoverable and losing the one nudge a context gets is not.
# Whoever can measure the harness should replace this paragraph with the answer.
#
# The value is the harness's, it is compared against this constant, and it is never printed
# -- so nothing here touches the rule about what may reach `additionalContext`.
