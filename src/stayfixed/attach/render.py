"""The overlay's executable parts, rendered into a local plugin named by the binding id.

**What runs is this directory, in place.** `claude plugin install --scope local` keeps a cache
copy, but a session runs the plugin from its marketplace's own directory, `<data>/delivery/<id>/`:
an edit there reaches the next session with no reinstall, and with the directory gone the plugin
does not load and nothing says so. So `attach` re-renders here on every run, and the directory is
always derived from the id, never read from a record a checkout keeps.

**The names are the defence.** Claude Code records a local-scope marketplace machine-wide, and a
clone that commits an `enabledPlugins` entry naming a plugin this machine knows runs its hooks. So
the marketplace is `stayfixed-delivery-<id>` and the plugin `overlay-<id>`, each carrying the whole
binding id, which never leaves this machine (`stayfixed.binding`): a clone cannot name what it never
saw. No other name of a delivered part is predictable, and none of these is ever printed.

**What is rendered.** The union of `<overlay>/common/claude/hooks.json` and
`<overlay>/projects/<project>/claude/hooks.json`, each event's entry groups common first, as the
overlay wrote them; and `skills/` and `agents/` copied from the same two directories, this
project's copy of a file winning over the common one. `<project>` is the project this machine's
binding record names, which the caller passes. Every source is read before anything is written
(`read_parts`), so a file that cannot be read stops the run while the render is as it was.

**The overlay's path-scoped rules** (`attach.rules`) add one entry: on `PostToolUse`, matching
`Read|Edit|Write`, `hook PostToolUse` run through whatever launched the stayfixed that renders
(`scoped_command`), by absolute paths, since the render is no part of the core plugin and has no
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` naming it. Run from the core plugin, or a checkout of it, that is the
plugin's own hook wrapper, `hooks/run-hook.sh` beside the running module's `src/`, which runs the
interpreter with `-I` and answers any fault with exit 0, as for the core plugin's own entries; run
from an installed package, which has no plugin root, it is the running interpreter with
`-I -m stayfixed`. Only what the running process knows about itself is asked. The entry is rendered
only when the overlay holds a rule with `paths:`. No entry is added to the core plugin's
`hooks/hooks.json`.

**The digest is a convenience, not a gate.** It is sha256 over every rendered file's path relative
to the render directory and its bytes, which the ledger keeps beside those paths so a later run can
say what changed and take back what the overlay no longer holds. The overlay is the owner's, and
its hooks run scripts from the overlay checkout in place, so a digest of this text would not even
cover what runs.
