"""What `stayfixed attach` actually writes, in the order the refusals have to happen in.

**No hook entry goes into `settings.local.json`.** Claude Code rewrites that file whole and adds
allow rules of its own to it, so no in-band marker survives there. The overlay's hook entries,
skills and agents are rendered into a local plugin named by the binding id (`attach.render`),
re-rendered in place and installed on every run, both `claude plugin` calls being idempotent; the
file keeps only the allow rules the ledger names, and the plugin's `enabledPlugins` and
`extraKnownMarketplaces` entries, which Claude Code writes. A checkout an earlier release attached
holds the entries that release merged, named by its ledger's `entries`: `attach` takes back
exactly those, through `scaffold.withdraw_entries`, and records none.

*Not the scaffold engine's `plan`/`apply` for the settings file.* The engine stamps a digest of
the document into the **committed** `.stayfixed/manifest.json`, which would publish a digest of
the owner's personal allow rules to every collaborator. The pure functions are called
instead — document string in, document string out, no manifest — and the ledger below takes
the manifest's place. This is the one place where refusing an existing mechanism is right.

An allow rule cannot carry a marker — `scaffold.mark` appends to a *command* — so it has exactly
**one** witness, the ledger at `.stayfixed/local/attach.json`, and `detach` is only ever as good
as that file.

**Delivery does not depend on the memory mode.** Every repository is rendered and installed; the
note half — the overlay's group directories, the composed store and the `autoMemoryDirectory` key
that points the harness at it — is made only for a repository whose `memory.mode` is `overlay`, and
every check that is about it is asked only there.

**One place per repository: the main checkout.** Claude Code reads the main checkout's
`settings.local.json` from every worktree and writes a worktree's own answers into it, so `attach`
and `detach` act on the main checkout whichever worktree they run from: its settings file, its
`.codex/rules/` copies and its ledger. Nothing is placed per worktree. Where git names no main
checkout, a bare repository's worktree, `attach` refuses with "cannot tell" (`NO_MAIN_CHECKOUT`).

**Nothing goes into `.gitignore`, and every placed path is ignored before the first write after
the exclude block.** `.gitignore` is tracked, so a line `attach` wrote there was a change every
collaborator got. Everything `attach` places in the checkout, the ledger with the owner's personal
allow rules included, is listed in the `info/exclude` block (`attach.exclude`), which no clone
carries; the block is written first, and git is then asked whether each placed path is ignored,
so a `.gitignore` that re-includes one (a `!` line outranks the exclude file) stops the run
before that path is written. The binding id is placed too, but in the git common directory, which
git never tracks, so it is neither listed nor asked about. `init`'s own `stayfixed:ignore` region
is `init`'s, and this module neither writes nor withdraws it.

**Every write goes through a primitive that already exists.** `fsops.write_within(root, …)` for
everything inside the project, `fsops.write_within(overlay, …)` for the overlay's project record,
and `stayfixed.binding` and `attach.render` for this machine's binding record and render.

    """The only witness an allow rule has, and the record `detach` acts from.

    Not *authority*, and the difference is the whole of this docstring. `.gitignore` does not
    untrack a file a clone committed, so this path can arrive in a fresh checkout with contents
    nobody on this machine wrote — and `detach` then deletes files by the strings in `rules` and
    drops settings keys by the strings in `settings_keys`. Obeyed, a ledger claiming
    `settings_keys = ["permissions"]` would delete the owner's whole `permissions` block, **deny
    rules included**: a widening driven by repository-authored bytes, out of a file that is no
    authority.

    So `ledger()` answers one question about every field before `detach` sees it — *what could
    `attach` possibly have written here?* — and refuses anything outside that answer rather than
    obeying it. The two fields that name things to destroy are bounded exactly:

    - `rules` may only be `.codex/rules/<file>`, the one place `permissions.codex_rules`
      enumerates, one path segment deep and never a dotfile; and
    - `settings_keys` may only be `autoMemoryDirectory`, the pointer at the composed store and the
      one key `_point` writes.

    `directories` is the third, and is bounded by membership in `CREATED_DIRS`. It records which
    of those directories this repository did **not** have before the attach, so `detach` can put
    the tree back as it found it; `rmdir` is the only removal it drives, so a directory holding
    anything at all survives regardless of what the ledger claims.

    `entries` keys must parse as marker ids, because `_write_ledger` builds them with
    `scaffold.marker_id` and nothing else can appear there.

    `allow` and `store` are not bounded here, and saying why is part of the rule rather than an
    omission. An allow rule has no grammar this area owns — the ledger exists *because* a rule
    cannot be told from the owner's own by its content — and `_withdraw_settings` only ever
    removes a rule the settings file already holds, so the worst a committed `allow` achieves is
    taking a permission away. `store` is read by nothing: `detach` derives every path it
    withdraws from the configuration and the overlay root, never from this field, so it is a
    record for a human reading the file and for `doctor`, and a committed value costs nothing —
    except one holding a NUL, which no path holds and `doctor`'s `Path.resolve` meets with
    `ValueError`, so that one is a ledger no attach wrote. So is any list field holding something
    other than a list, which reading it would meet with `TypeError`.

    `entries` maps each marker id to its event, which is the shape `scaffold.owned_ids` answers
    in, so `doctor` can compare the two without a translation in between. Only a ledger an earlier
    release wrote holds any: `attach` merges no hook entry now, takes back the ones recorded here,
    and records none.

    `render` is the digest and the parts of the render the last run installed, `None` before the
    first. It decides one thing, whether `attach` runs `claude plugin` again, and names nothing to
    destroy: each part is held to a path the contained walk accepts, and it is removed only from
    under `delivery_directory(id)`, which is derived from the id and never from this file.

    The main checkout first, whichever worktree this runs from, and every read and write after

    Then the order below is the order they are enumerated in: read the binding, which already
    refuses a store outside the machine-recorded overlay; compute the diff, which gates nothing,
    since the overlay is the owner's and what it grants is shown rather than refused; refuse a
    `memory.groups` entry that leaves this project's share of the overlay; read the existing
    ledger, which refuses one no attach could have written; ask git what it already hides, which
    refuses a `check-ignore` with no answer, a placed path that leaves the project and a symlinked
    or unwritable exclude file; read the overlay's rule sources and the parts the plugin carries,
    which the writes below would otherwise read for themselves; then write the exclude block,
    refuse a placed path git would still not ignore (`exclude.NOT_IGNORED`), and only then write
    any file the block hides. The `memory.groups` containment is asked only of a repository whose
    `memory.mode` is `overlay`, whose notes are composed; delivery does not depend on the mode.

    **The split is what holds that order.** `_plan` reads and refuses and returns an
    `AttachPlan`; `_carry_out` takes only that value and writes. A read the writes need is a
    field of the plan, so it cannot drift below the first write the way the rule sources and the
    worktree listing each once did.

    **Neither a missing `origin` nor one the records do not name refuses.** The binding is the id
    `stayfixed.binding` writes into the git common directory, which no clone carries, and the
    machine's record of it; the remote decides nothing, so it is a note (`NO_ORIGIN_NOTE`,
    `memory.store.origin_note`).

    The binding is written before the composed store, the id and the machine's record first,
    because the store is named by the id and resolves only for a bound checkout. The render follows
    the binding, since it is named by the id, and is installed with two idempotent `claude plugin`
    calls on every run; the ledger records it once they succeed, and a call that fails exits 1 with
    the exclude block standing, so a re-run completes.

    `runner` is keyword-**required** rather than defaulted so that no test can reach a real
    `claude`. `owner` is the owner's layer the command resolved, which the one load
    takes (`config.loader.loads`' own). `project` is `--project`, which names the project of a

    see them.

    **Three things keep this from deleting somebody's directory.** It walks `CREATED_DIRS`, a

    the first write, so a directory that was already there is never on it. And the removal is
    `rmdir`: a directory holding anything else at all — the owner's own `.claude/settings.json`,
    a `.codex/rules/` file they wrote by hand, a file some other tool left — survives, and its
    parents then survive with it because they are not empty either.

    `OSError`, so a component of one of these paths that became a symlink between the check and
    the call is caught here too — the walk refuses it, the directory stays, and the detach
    finishes; that is the same answer "not empty" gets, and the right one for a path this
