"""The `attach` and `detach` groups: `attach` binds a repository to the overlay, and `detach`
takes back what `attach` wrote and leaves the overlay's record of the binding in place.

Two top-level commands and not one group with two subcommands, because that is how
`docs/cli.md` lists them and the shape the skills already invoke.
