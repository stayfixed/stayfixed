"""Which overlay this repository is bound to, and whether the binding is really this one's.

**Three rules keep the overlay trusted, and two of them live here.** The overlay is trusted *by
construction*, and the construction is that `config.machine.machine_config_path` makes the machine
file unselectable by a repository — that module spends twenty lines on why gating one of a pair of
equivalent variables "is not a partial defence, it is a redirect with a longer name". So:

1. the overlay root comes from `overlay_root(machine)` and never from `--store`. Deriving it
   from the store's own parent would make the source of every allow rule and every hook entry
   `attach` merges a path on a command line — in a harness where command lines are written by a
   model that has read the repository; and
2. `--store` must be exactly `<overlay>/projects/<name>/memory`, which is what
   `permitted_roots(overlay, name)` already calls this project's own share. A store elsewhere
   under the overlay would attach and then fail on every session start, because `memory.store`
   holds every linked group to those same two roots — so `attach` would have produced a store
   the hook path refuses, which is the worst of both.

The third rule is a write and lives in `write.py`.

**Whether a checkout is bound is this machine's answer, not the overlay's.** The binding is the id
in the checkout's git common directory and the machine's record of it (`stayfixed.binding`); the
overlay's `projects/<name>/project.toml` keeps the remote and the first attach's date for the
owner to read, and never decides whether a checkout is bound; for a repository with no
`stayfixed.toml`, its remote is one way the project is chosen (`choose_project`).

**The two remotes on a `Binding` are repository-authored bytes** (principle 5), and nothing
here puts either into a refusal message or a `Result.data`. They reach a line only inside
`note`, through `printed.quoted` (`memory.store.origin_note`). The state is one of
`memory.store.binding_state`'s two labels, stayfixed's own, and may be printed.
