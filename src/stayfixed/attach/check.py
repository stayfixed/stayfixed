"""`stayfixed attach --check`: what `attach` would do, read the way `attach` reads it, with nothing
written.

A module of its own, above everything it reads through: the binding and the permission diff
(`binding`, `permissions`), and what the real run asks before its first write, which it asks
through the writer's own planning (`write`). `write` imports `permissions` for the diff it
merges, so the preview cannot live in `permissions` without the two importing each other; here
each import runs one way, and `tests/boundaries/test_layering.py` holds the modules under
`src/stayfixed/` to a graph without a cycle, imports inside a function included.

    A moved `origin` is a note on the line, as the run says it (`Binding.note`), and never a
    finding: the remote binds nothing.

    The `Config` is loaded once and handed to both halves: `read_binding` takes it rather than
    loading a second one. Two loads could disagree, and a `--check` whose two halves read
    different documents is exactly what it exists to rule out. Past the binding it takes the run's
    gates and plans the run's writes (`gates`, `plan_writes`), so a refusal or failure there ends
    this command with the run's code and line: each of them was once left out here, and `--check`
    answered clean over a checkout the run then stopped on. `owner` is the owner's layer the
    command resolved (`config.loader.loads`' own), and `project` is `--project`, which names the
    project of a repository with no `stayfixed.toml` as the run's does (`write.configured`).
