"""One writer for every file stayfixed replaces in place, and one way to reach it safely.

Two problems, one module.

*Atomicity, and durability.* A note, an index and a scaffolded artifact are each a file a
person may be editing, and a bare `write_text` truncates before it writes: a crash in between
leaves an empty file where the only copy of a note was. `mkstemp` plus `os.replace` makes the
replacement atomic, and the mode of the replaced file is carried over, because a fresh
temporary is 0600 and silently tightening `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md` or a workflow file is a
defect of its own. Atomicity is not durability, and the crash argument above asks for both:
`os.replace` guarantees that a reader sees the old file or the new one and never a half-written
one, and guarantees nothing about what survives power loss. So the bytes are `fsync`ed before
the rename and the directory is `fsync`ed after it — without the first, the rename can be
durable while the data is not, which is the zero-length note this module exists to prevent.

*Containment that survives the write.* Validating a path string and then writing to it leaves
a window in which a component can become a symlink, and the clone may be running a process of
its own. `open_within` walks the path one component at a time with `O_NOFOLLOW`, so a symlink
anywhere along it fails the open rather than redirecting it, and returns a directory
descriptor the write then happens relative to. The string is never resolved again.

**`open_within` contains, and the name is the contract.** The walk refuses symlinks; for a
while it refused nothing else, so `..` walked out of the root one component at a time and an
absolute `relative` restarted the walk at `/` — `openat` ignores its `dir_fd` for an absolute
path. On Linux, where `/etc` and `/var` are real directories, that completed and yielded a
descriptor outside the root; macOS refused it only incidentally, because those two happen to
be symlinks there. No caller reached it — `scaffold.engine` calls `contained()` first — but
the seam is the point: every area that puts a file into a repository calls it instead of writing
files of its own, and the name of this function is what those callers read as the guarantee. It
is the guarantee now.

`contained()` in `config.paths` is still the right first call for a *configured* string: it
answers about the project root, reports a `Refusal` a user can act on, and catches a committed
symlink before any descriptor is opened. This is the floor under it, not a replacement for it.

A leaf module: it imports nothing from `stayfixed`, so the hook path pays no area import to
reach it. That is also why the write helpers below raise `OSError` and `UnsafePath` rather
than `stayfixed.errors.Refusal` — the area that owns a user-facing verdict translates them.

# root. So the party being contained is the clone, which authors the path string and can author
# nothing else here: it cannot move `.git`, cannot choose the root, and cannot rename the
# directory out from under this check.
#
# **Case-insensitively**, because the default filesystem on macOS is case-insensitive and
# `.GIT/hooks/pre-commit` reaches the same file there; **at every depth**, because a `.git`
# below the top is a submodule's control directory and is exactly as off-limits.
#
# **`.git` and not "a leading dot".** `.github/workflows/stayfixed.yml` is an artifact this
# project ships and `.stayfixed/manifest.json` is its own ledger, so a leading-dot rule would
# refuse stayfixed's own footprint. `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` and `.gitkeep` are ordinary
# files and are untouched by an equality test on the whole component.
#
# The one place stayfixed does write inside `.git` is `guards.githooks.install`, and it does not
# come through here: git itself names the directory (`rev-parse --git-path hooks`), the result
# is an absolute path this process computed, and the write is `write_atomically`, the plain-path
# form for a caller that already holds a trusted path. No repository-authored string reaches it.

    only about the values nobody has to think about. Those parts are normalised, so `docs//x.md`,
    `docs/x/` and `./docs` would reach such a copy as `('docs', 'x.md')`, `('docs', 'x')` and
    `('docs',)`: a configured path that `plan()` reports no refusal for and that the walk below
    then refuses at the write, part-way through a pass, with earlier artifacts already on disk.
    That is also why this is not private: `contained()` is in a subpackage and this is a leaf
    module, so the call goes this way and the leaf stays a leaf.

    The split is on the **raw string**, not on `PurePosixPath(relative).parts`. Those parts are
    already normalised — `.` and empty segments are dropped, a trailing slash disappears — so a
    guard written against them can only ever see what pathlib chose to keep, and the one
    component it does keep is the one that escapes. Reading the caller's own spelling means
    every refusal below is a refusal of something a caller can actually write:

    * the empty path, and any path that is only separators;
    * an absolute path — `openat` ignores its `dir_fd` for one, so the walk would restart at
      the filesystem root;
    * `..`, which walks out one component at a time; and `.`, and an empty segment (`a//b`, a
      trailing slash), which are merely odd rather than dangerous — refused because this
      function's answer is what every caller reads as "contained", and a surface that quietly
      rewrites its argument is a surface whose guarantee has to be restated per caller;
    * a component holding a NUL, which names no file anywhere and which every path call meets
      with a `ValueError` rather than an `OSError`;
    * and git's control directory, at any depth and in any case — see `CONTROL_DIRECTORY`.

      `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is inside every root stayfixed is ever handed, and a clone that
      pointed a `MANAGED_REGION` artifact at it had the developer's executable hook rewritten
      in place, because `_mode_of` carries an existing file's 0755 onto the replacement. This
      is the last line before the write, under `contained()` rather than instead of it, and it
