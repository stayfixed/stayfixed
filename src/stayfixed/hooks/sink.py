"""Where the dispatcher's markers and diagnostics survive between invocations.

Two of the three path segments below are payload-controlled — the marker key a handler chose, and
the session id off the hook's stdin — so both are hashed to a fixed-width hex name, and every write
and removal still goes through `fsops`' `O_NOFOLLOW` walk. Two controls rather than one, because
what runs here is not only a write but a `remove_within` loop over a directory listing: one of the
two removals the enumerated-writes rule (CONTRIBUTING.md#enumerated-writes) lets a listing drive,
and only inside this one directory.

Nothing here ever raises at its caller. A hook runs on every tool call, so an unwritable
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` must cost a lost marker and never a refused Bash command — which is
the degradation `NullSink`'s own docstring already promises, reached here by returning one.
