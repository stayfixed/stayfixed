"""The hooks area's import surface — and the one that **defines** rather than re-exports.

Every other area's `api.py` is a list of re-exports whose `__all__` equals what it imports.
This one cannot be, and the difference is structural rather than a lapse: the handler
vocabulary below is what `stayfixed.hooks.registry`, `stayfixed.hooks.dispatch`,
`stayfixed.hooks.sink` and every area's `hooks.py` import, so a name defined in one of those
modules and re-exported here would be an import cycle — `sink.py` imports `Sink` and
`NullSink` from this module, and this module would import the sink's layout back out of it.

So the rule this area follows is the other half of the same rule: **a name two areas share is
defined here.** The four names of the sink's on-disk layout live here for exactly that reason,
and `sink.py` imports them from here like everybody else. CONTRIBUTING records the exception.
Which harness a hook runs under is not vocabulary of this kind, and no handler is told it:
`stayfixed.harnesses.detect` says why.

**Six names below have no importer outside this area**, and each stays for the reason beside it:

- `EVENTS` is the list a handler's event must come from: `registry.discover` refuses any other,
  and an area that needs a new event adds it here, beside the vocabulary its handlers use.
- `HandlerFn` is `Handler.run`'s type. `Handler` is what `guards/hooks.py` and
  `memory/hooks.py` build, and a consumer that holds one before registering it — a table of
  handlers, a decorator, a test double — cannot annotate the callable without this name.
- `Sink` is the protocol `dispatch.py` takes and `sink.py` implements, and `NullSink` is the
  degradation it falls back to when there is no harness data root. `doctor` reports on the tree
  those two write (`DIRECTORY`, `MARKERS`, `DIAGNOSTICS`), so the layout is published and the
  writer's own shape should be nameable beside it.
- `DATA_ROOT_VARIABLES` is what `data_root` asks, which `sink.py` and `doctor` both call: a
  harness that names its data root in a variable of its own is one more entry there.
- `first_set` is the one rule a hook finds a directory in its environment by: `data_root` asks it
  for the data root and `dispatch.read_event` for the project root. It is defined here because
  hook discovery imports this module and the rule needs neither the harness registry nor the
  configuration layer, which discovery imports neither of.

For this area, removing a name from `__all__` is not a trim in any case: `api.py` defines these
and `tests/test_surfaces.py` holds `DEFINES_ITS_OWN` areas to `imported | defined == __all__`,
so a defined name absent from the list reddens the contract. Trimming one is a decision to move
its definition into a private module, which is a different change with a different argument.
