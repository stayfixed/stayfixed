"""Every `stayfixed.<area>.hooks.register()` result, in area-name order, with no shared list.

Nothing keys or de-duplicates handlers by their own name: two areas may register the same
handler name and both run. What discovery does enforce is the event vocabulary, so a mistyped
`event` fails loudly here instead of shipping a guard that never fires.
