"""Regenerate the "Design and plan trail" listing inside the roadmap.

The roadmap's prose owns phase status; this listing makes the corpus navigable: every spec and
plan, grouped by theme, annotated with its delivery state. Delivered is the default; anything
else is declared in `trail.toml` beside the roadmap — that file is the one part a human
maintains, and it is the forward track in machine-readable form. A document
appearing for the first time has to declare its state, `delivered` included: a design is
written before the thing is built, so the first listing of one would otherwise assert that
unimplemented work has shipped.
