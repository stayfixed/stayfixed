"""Lint implementation plans: references, verification steps, `Scope:`, and `Premise:`.

The first two rules come from one branch's retro. A plan contradicted itself about a test
location and the stale pointer survived into three later tasks — so every reference must
resolve unless the line says `(create)`. And a step phrased "confirm nothing bounds X" embeds
its own expected answer: the author already doubted it enough to write the check and hid that
doubt from whoever executes it. That one shipped an open defect. The verb is not special to
"confirm" — "verify" and "check" hide the same doubt the same way — so all three are covered,
guarded against the compound-word false positive a bare `no` produces (`no-op` is not the
negation `no`).

A path the plan removes is the first rule's claim run backwards: it resolves until its task lands
and never after, and a finished plan is history that a later change may still edit. So a
`Delete:` line declares its paths as `Create:` does, and `(delete)` marks its line as `(create)`
does.

The `Scope:` and `Premise:` rules come from the same retro: an unrelated change rode a bugfix
plan because nothing on the plan named what belonged to it, and a fix's own discriminator
outran the entry evidence it was supposedly fixing because nothing forced that evidence onto
the page.

The mutation-outcome rule comes from the next branch's, where one plan wrote three
discrimination proofs as settled results and all three were wrong. The first reddened every
test in its module instead of the one named, at import, because the removal it described broke
a key-parity invariant. The second could not have gone red at all: the function it mutated
swallows everything in its own `try`/`catch`. And the third predicted a fail-closed test would
stay green under a mutation that test's own call-count assertion cannot survive. Written as
predictions they would have been checked; written as facts they were read as evidence the
assertions discriminated, and the branch shipped believing three oracles nobody had watched
fail.

Prediction and report are told apart by TENSE, not by a keyword either has to carry. A plan is
written before the work and a report after it, so "the test reddens" is a forecast while "the
test reddened" is an observation, and English marks that difference in the verb itself. So the
rule's vocabulary is present tense and nothing else: a plan reporting a mutation it already ran
is not exempted, it is never matched. `Expected:` is the one marker the rule does read, because
it is how an author says a present-tense sentence is a forecast on purpose. The vocabulary is
the colour idiom, present tense, and deliberately not `fails`/`passes`, which every plan uses
for the TDD red step; measured on the corpus this lint was written against, admitting them
multiplied the findings by thirty and almost all of the rise was correct prose. Bounding the
outcome to within `_OUTCOME_SPAN` characters of the instruction that governs it is the other
half of that narrowing — it separates a consequence from an unrelated later clause of a long
paragraph.

The claim is a SENTENCE, so the rule reads paragraphs and not lines. Scanning line by line made
catching a false discrimination proof depend on where the text happened to wrap: an arrow
ending one line with `redden` opening the next went unflagged while the identical claim two
lines below, short enough to fit, was flagged. Blocks are joined and each character keeps its
source line, so a report still names the line the claim starts on. The `Expected:` marker is
read over the claim's own SENTENCE, which is the unit that marker marks: a marker in a
neighbouring sentence of the same paragraph exempts nothing, and one written after the claim is
not read at all.

These are floors. A regular expression cannot judge whether a computed number's model covers
its subject; that rule lives in the plan template and the review lens.

Scope is the diff, not the corpus: plans are immutable history, so a finished plan pointing at a
deleted module is a correct record, not a defect. Two things depart from that rule. A `root`
that is not a git repository at all — the normal state only for a lint-fixture tree in a test,
never for a real checkout — lints every plan under `paths.plans`, so the fixtures that pin these
rules actually discriminate instead of passing vacuously through an unresolvable diff. And
named `PATH` arguments lint exactly those plans, because a developer editing a plan is looking
at the file on disk, not at a commit that does not exist yet; the plans the working tree holds
beyond the diff are reported as `unlinted` rather than linted silently, so the remedy is to name
the file.

The same holds within a plan. A delivered plan's `Interfaces:` blocks are kept current, so a later
change edits plans whose other lines name paths the tree has since moved or removed, and holding
it to those made the only way through a rewrite of history. In the diff-scoped mode a reference
is therefore settled only on a line the change wrote (`written_lines`): a new plan is all such
lines, and an edit is held to its own. Every other rule still reads the whole plan, and naming a
plan as `PATH` still settles every reference in it.

A repository whose BASE will not resolve is a finding and not an OK. Printing a note and exiting
0 is how a gate like this one runs green for its whole life without ever having linted anything:
a CI checkout made at the default depth of 1 holds no base ref, so the diff cannot be taken and
no plan could have failed whatever it contained. A check that cannot answer must say so in its
exit code.

    A plan is one of them when HEAD's copy differs from `base`'s and from that of any commit
    `gitenv.fork_points` names. If it equals every fork point's, git's merge takes the base's
    copy; if it equals the base's, the merge leaves it as it is; either way merging alters
    nothing. Every fork point, not the one `<base>...HEAD` diffs against: that one can already
    hold an old plan the change puts back. And the base too, because against a fork point alone
    a plan the base changed since it reads as the change's own.

    Read with `-z`, the same way and for the same reason as `unlinted_plans`: without it git
    C-quotes any path holding a space or a non-ASCII byte, splitting on whitespace then tears

    git argv slot ahead of any `--`, where git reads it as its own option: a `--base` of
