    2 — telling the operator this tool is broken rather than that their file is, with nothing in
    the message to act on. A repository's malformed input must read as their input being wrong.

    The same treatment and the same shape as `ledger.entries.read_ledger_text`, which the ledger

    the area whose vocabulary its message speaks. The exception is not rendered — it names the
    offending byte, and the byte came out of the file.
