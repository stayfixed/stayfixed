"""The `memory` group. Every command takes `--store PATH`.

`--store` is an override of *where the notes are*, not of the rules about them, and overlay mode
does not read it: there the store is the composed one the binding names. `--machine` exists for
the same reason the resolver takes one — a test that did not thread it would read the developer's
real configuration.

It is threaded exactly twice, into `command_config` (`session_config` for `session-context`,
which reads the file the way a session does) and into `resolve`, and never again: `resolve` puts
it on the `Store` it builds, so every later call takes it from there. It used to be an optional
keyword on about twenty functions, and the only thing keeping a command's overlay and its index
destination in agreement was that each of those call sites remembered to pass it.
