"""Notes nobody promoted, and words a repository wrote, reach the model as data, inside a region
no note can close.

A store committed to the repository reaches a session as the harness delivers the same
repository's `CLAUDE.md`: with no approval, and still as data. The marker is a delimited region
with a per-invocation nonce, not a prefix. A prefix ends where the note's first line begins, so a
note can simply write its own closing sentence and carry on as if it were the owner's
configuration. A nonce the note cannot predict means the region's end is not forgeable, and a
nonce the note already holds is drawn again (`wrap`), so a note that quotes a marker, or carries
the drawn hex by chance, still cannot close the region it is wrapped in.
