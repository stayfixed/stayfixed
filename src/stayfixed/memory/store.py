"""Where the notes are, and the four ways that answer can be a lie.

A store is a per-project value with no machine-level default, because the wrong answer is not
"no memory" but *another project's* memory reaching this session. Four things are therefore
checked, and each closes a hole the other three leave open:

1. **The shape.** In overlay mode the store is the composed store `attach` builds under this
   machine's data directory, named by the checkout's binding id (`composed_directory`), holding
   one link per group: `developer` points into the overlay's `common/memory`, which is shared
   across projects and cannot live under `projects/<name>/`. It is the directory the harness reads
   through `autoMemoryDirectory`, so stayfixed's bundles and the harness read one store. In
   `in-repo` mode `paths.memory` is a real directory, never one link for the whole store.
2. **Containment inside the store.** A group name is repository-controlled — `memory.groups`
   is an ordinary `stayfixed.toml` list — so `groups = ["../secret"]` must not become a read,
   and certainly not a write, outside the store. `config/paths.py` says in as many words that
   this field reaches no guard of its own and that the module consuming it owns the check.
3. **The link's target.** A link is honoured only when it lands inside *this project's* share
   of the recorded overlay: `common/memory`, or `projects/<the bound name>/memory`. Testing
   containment in the overlay root alone lets an honestly-named, honestly-bound project point
   one directory sideways at another client's notes.
4. **The binding.** This machine must record the checkout's binding id, kept in its git common
   directory, as bound to this project (`stayfixed.binding`): a clone that names itself after
   one of the owner's projects has no id, so nothing binds it. `git` runs with a scrubbed
   environment, because an inherited `GIT_DIR` would otherwise answer for a different
   repository altogether.

**What the environment can and cannot choose.** The store's *location* is never named by a variable
this process reads: `resolve` takes an `env` mapping and ignores it by contract, and
`gitenv.git_answer` runs with a scrubbed environment, so neither a `STAYFIXED_STORE`-shaped variable
nor an inherited `GIT_DIR` can point this module at another project's notes. Both halves are pinned
by tests, and both matter because a committed `.claude/settings.json` may carry an `env` block that
applies with no trust prompt in a non-interactive session.

**The machine file makes the same claim.** `machine_config_path` reads neither
`STAYFIXED_CONFIG` nor `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, since gating one alone is worth nothing: each of them
reaches the same file, and this area routes the store's overlay anchor (`overlay_root(None)`) and
the trust record (`trust.record.record_path(None)`) through it. A committed `env` block setting
`STAYFIXED_CONFIG`, or direnv, mise or a devcontainer setting `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` from a file the
clone commits, would choose which overlay root `permitted_roots` is computed from, and which
`trust.json` `may_inject` consults, wherever no `--machine` is threaded.

Stated exactly, because the exposure is not the same size as the invariant: pointing a variable
somewhere of the author's choosing would **suppress** memory — no overlay root and no recorded
digest means overlay stores refuse to resolve and the gate fails closed — while making it
*grant* anything would additionally require a pre-recorded hash matching a digest of the store
at the clone's absolute path, which is the key `trust` records under. It is still an invariant
two other properties lean on, and holding it in `config/machine.py` — the foundation's file — is
what makes the claim above about `env` a claim about the whole module rather than about
`resolve` alone.

    answer that there is no store at all — and nothing would be linked in the one place this

    **Registration is the question containment would only stand in for.** A linked worktree's
    private git directory is `<common-dir>/worktrees/<name>`, and that directory holds a
    `gitdir` file naming the `.git` file the worktree was created for. Both halves are

    hook, once per bundle entry. The two functions below stay, because a caller that wants only one
    of the two answers should not have to say so; this is the one for callers that want both.

    The reason's `detail` is repository-authored text: see `refusal_reason` for what that
    obliges a consumer to do with it. Its `said` is stayfixed's own and prints as it is.
