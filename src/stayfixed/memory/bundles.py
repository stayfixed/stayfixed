"""What each `SessionStart` entry injects, and how much of it fits.

One entry per bundle, each rendered by `memory session-context --bundle <name> --part <n>`,
and **no dispatcher handler**. That is not a style choice. Foundation's `hook <event>` takes
an event name and runs every handler registered for it, joining their contexts and clamping
the join to one platform cap — so the six numbered slots registered as handlers would concatenate
back into a single 10,000-character budget and be truncated, which is precisely the defect
a cap per `SessionStart` slot exists to remove. Invoked as separate `hooks.json` entries, each
slot gets its own cap, and the text is emitted raw rather than through a JSON envelope, so the
margin below is genuinely additive instead of fighting `ensure_ascii`'s six characters per
non-ASCII point.

Standing rules are never truncated, only flagged: a standing rule that does not arrive is a
standing rule that gets broken, and the set is hand-curated by a flag, so its size is
somebody's decision rather than an accident.

# **A named cap (CONTRIBUTING.md#named-caps), and no shipped file changes with it.** There is no
# such file for this one and there should not be: it is the headroom between a cap this area does
# not own and the way this area emits text, and a project that could widen it would be a project
# that could make its own bundles overrun the platform truncation silently. The cap it is subtracted
# from, `hook_output_chars`, is a `[native_caps]` key, which is where a change to the platform's
# number belongs.
#
# **For `hooks/hooks.json`, whose slot count `doctor` checks `SLOTS` against: its entries must
# not pass `--json`.** The margin is additive only because `memory session-context` prints
# the text raw. Through `cli._emit`'s `json.dumps({"summary": ...}, indent=2)` the envelope and
# the escaping both count against the same platform cap, and a cap-length standing bundle no
# longer fits — measured at 10,009 characters for the single-block bundle
# `test_the_margin_is_additive_because_the_text_is_emitted_raw` builds, and 10,146 for a
# realistic multi-note one, whose extra newlines each escape to two characters. Widening
# `CAP_MARGIN` is not the fix; not wrapping the output is.
