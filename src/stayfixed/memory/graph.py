"""The advisory memory link graph: every `[[link]]` resolves to a document in the store, no link is
immediately repeated, no ledger identifier is bracketed. Advice, never a verdict: the store is
shared by every session on the machine, so `memory refs` reports these as notices that never
change its exit code.

The wiki-link grammar is defined here, as the link graph's own, and `memory.refs` reads it through
`wiki_links` for its audience check; the identifier grammar is the bug ledger's, read through
`stayfixed.ledger.api`, and what counts as prose is `stayfixed.prose`'s. The notes come from the
walk `memory.refs` already made for its own findings, so `memory refs` reads the store once.
