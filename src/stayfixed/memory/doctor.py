"""This area's rows in `stayfixed doctor`: `bundles` and `memory`.

Both read the note store, and the store is this area's to resolve. `doctor`'s core
discovers this module by name and asks its rows after its own (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Areas"), so the
core never resolves the store and nothing about it lives in the report's `Context`. The store comes
from the `Answers` (`memory.answers`) this module's `register()` creates, one per report, so both
rows read one answer.

Every import sits inside a function body, as in a `hooks.py`: this module is imported by
discovery, and a module-level import here would be one more thing every `doctor` run loads before
it has asked anything.
