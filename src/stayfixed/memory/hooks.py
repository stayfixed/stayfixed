"""What a session hears about the store's unreviewed notes: one count line, when the set is news.

`unreviewed-notes` counts the notes the owner has not promoted at their current bytes
(`memory.reviewed`) and says so on `SessionStart` only when that set differs from the one the last
session over the same store was told about, so a store nobody changed costs no line. The set is
remembered as one digest of the notes' resolved paths, in `<data>/unreviewed/`, a file per store
named by a hash of the store's path; it holds no path and no name. The line is fixed text with a
count interpolated, so nothing a note or a repository wrote reaches it.

No `once_key`: a compacted or cleared context asks again, and hears nothing unless the set moved.
Every import below the vocabulary is inside the handler body, for discovery's reason
(`attach/hooks.py` says it).
