"""The composed store: the one directory on this machine that the harness reads memory from.

**One directory, named by the binding id, outside every checkout.** `<data>/stores/<id>/` holds a
link per group into the overlay — `developer` to `<overlay>/common/memory`, the shared notes, and
each directory of `<overlay>/projects/<project>/memory/` to itself — and `MEMORY.md`, a link to the
index `stayfixed memory index` renders in that share. `attach` builds it in `overlay` mode and
writes its absolute path as `autoMemoryDirectory` into the main checkout's excluded
`settings.local.json`, which Claude Code reads from every worktree, so the harness reads the
overlay's notes through one key and no per-worktree link. `<project>` is the project this machine's
binding record names, which the caller passes, and the groups are the directories the overlay
holds for it: no name the repository chose becomes a path here.

**It is the overlay-mode store stayfixed reads too** (`store.resolve`), so the bundles and the
harness read one directory, and `attach` renders the index behind its `MEMORY.md` link where the
overlay has none yet (`render_missing_index`), so neither reads a dangling one.

**What stayfixed places here is links, and only links are taken.** The harness writes into the
directory it reads, so a file here that is not a link is a note it wrote, and neither a rebuild nor
a withdrawal removes it. `build` makes the store's links exactly the overlay's current set and
`withdraw` takes them all, then the directory where nothing else is left. Both list this
directory, which is derived from the id and never read from a record a checkout keeps, and only
`attach` puts links in it (CONTRIBUTING.md#enumerated-writes). The path names the whole id, so it
is never printed: a fault names the data directory and the id's short form (`binding.unwritten`).
