"""One note, read and written without losing what this reader does not understand.

The store has two writers: the harness's native memory writer and stayfixed. That is workable
only because neither rewrites the other's keys — and "does not rewrite" has to mean *bytes*,
not *meaning*. A reader that parses `description: 'tis a note` and renders it back as
`description: "'tis a note"` has changed a file it was asked to leave alone; do that to
seventy notes and the first `memory index` is a diff nobody can review, followed by a
ping-pong with the native writer over quoting.

So the frontmatter is kept as the lines it arrived as, and `render_note` rewrites **only the
keys whose value this run actually changed**. Byte-identity for an untouched note is then a
property of the design rather than a property of the quoting rules, and bit-compatibility with
the native writer holds for keys this module has never heard of.

A YAML library would be the obvious parser and is not available: the runtime is stdlib-only
so that a hook works before any environment exists. The grammar below is the smallest one the
real corpus needs — flat `key: value`, plus exactly one two-space block under `metadata:` —
and it refuses anything else loudly, with a line number, rather than guessing.
