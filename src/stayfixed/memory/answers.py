"""The note store a delivery row in `stayfixed doctor` reads, resolved at most once per area per
report.

`Answers` is what a delivery area's `doctor.py` creates in its `register()`, for its own rows, and
`register()` is called once per report, so nothing one run resolved reaches the next — the suite
runs many reports in one process. Each area that reads the store creates its own, so the store is
resolved once for each such area in a report and not once for the report: `memory`'s two rows
share one, and `attach`'s row has its own. Sharing one between areas would need a value both
`register()` calls reach, and the only value the report hands every area is its `Context`, which
is the core's and may hold nothing of this area. In overlay mode a resolution asks `git` for the
checkout's `origin`, so the count of resolutions is a count of launches, and
`tests/test_install_path.py` pins it. The overlay root is not here: it is a key of the machine
file, which the core owns, so the report resolves it once for every area (`Context.overlay_root`).

A module of its own rather than a name in `memory/doctor.py`, which discovery imports and which is
for that alone: `memory/api.py` publishes `Answers`, and every importer of that surface would
otherwise load this area's doctor rows with it.
