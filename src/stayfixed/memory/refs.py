"""Backticked repository paths in notes that no longer resolve (`memory refs`), and the link
graph's advice beside them, over one walk of the store.

Notes are read as authoritative and they age silently: nothing in the tree points back at
them, so a module they name can be deleted without anything going red, and the next session
is sent after it. A candidate is dropped whenever the tree can explain it: shorthand under a
source root, an absolute path outside this repository, a placeholder, or a path the
repository's own ignore rules cover — except a reference into the store itself, which the
ignore rules cover wholesale and which is therefore always settled against the filesystem.
Intent is not inferred: a reference wrapped in prose saying the file is gone is still reported;
write such a path in *italics*, and the prose says what it said with nothing to report.

What the walk could not read is reported beside what it found: a note that exists and would
not parse is not a clean note, for the reason the ledger's sweep reports a file it could not
read. A configured group the resolver could not provide is a refusal, from the resolver's own
record.
