"""The index is a rendering, not a file anyone edits.

Two machines editing one hand-written index is the most contended file in the store; a
generated one is resolved by regeneration. The curation does not disappear, it moves into each
note's `index:` line, or its `metadata.index`, or its description, read afresh on every render
and written into no note — and because a second writer appends its own lines to the index, the
generator harvests those into their notes before it renders, so nothing a session wrote is lost.

Sections come from `[memory] groups`, one per folder, and a note's `group` is rendered as a
sub-heading *inside* its folder's section. A note's folder is its default group, and read
literally that default would put a `group` value into the section list, which no configuration
declares; nesting the group under its folder is the reading that keeps both rules true.

    overlay mode, while these are pointers to documents in the repository and a link at the
    last component escaping the root is the same escape as one halfway up.

    An entry that escapes is dropped, the way `_group_targets` drops a group whose target it

    put to `notes.is_one_line` rather than answered a second time here: this string is rendered
    into the same `- [title](target)` shape the harvest reads back out into a note's one-line
    `index:`, so the two ends of that round trip must not disagree about what one line is —

    `index_source` is the rule every *reader* applies — `_appended`. The writer
    did not apply it and neither did the check, and each half of that was its own defect.
    `write_atomically` ends in `os.replace`, which replaces the **link** rather than its target:
    one run stranded the overlay's shared copy on every other machine, turned the index into a
    real file inside the repository, and so flipped `in_repository` to True and closed the trust
    gate on the index for good. `check_index` meanwhile read `store.path / INDEX_NAME` through
    `is_file()`, which follows the link, so `--check` answered about a file no reader sources:
    exit 0 and "index is current" while every reader refused the link it had followed.

    Both are the same question, so both ask it here, once.

    `None` from `index_source` has **three** causes, not two, and only one of them is a
    `Refusal`. An index that is simply absent (no file, no symlink) is the ordinary first run:
    the destination is the real path, and the check reports drift against nothing. An index
    that **is** a symlink comes apart into the other two: *refused* — outside overlay mode, or
    resolving outside this project's share of the overlay — where writing would clobber exactly
    the link the target rule declined to honour, and *permitted but not yet created* — `attach`
    creates the symlink before `memory index` ever renders a file behind it, so the very first
    run in an overlay project always finds this shape. `index_source` answers None for the
    second and third causes alike, because both are "nothing to read" — but they are not the
    same answer *here*: refused is a boundary this store may never write across, and
    permitted-but-dangling is precisely the file this command exists to create. Collapsing them
    made overlay mode unable to bootstrap at all.

    So this does not read `index_source`'s None as one thing. When it is None because the
    target is not a symlink at all, the ordinary-first-run answer applies unconditionally. When
    it is None because the target *is* a symlink, `_resolved_if_permitted` is asked the same
    permission question `index_source` asked — but without requiring the far end to already
    exist, which is the one difference the write side needs from the read side. A permitted
