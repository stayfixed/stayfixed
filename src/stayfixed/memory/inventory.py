"""What a sweep reads (`memory inventory`, `docs/cli.md#stayfixed-memory-inventory`).

`--json` is the primary output: the `memory-sweep` skill consumes this, and the human
rendering is a convenience. Staleness applies only to the volatile group — a durable note has
no expiry, and flagging one teaches the reader to ignore the flag.
