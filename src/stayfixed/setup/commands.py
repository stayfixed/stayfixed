"""The `setup` command: configure this machine from a preset, once.

One command and not a group with subcommands, the same shape `attach`/`detach` take: `setup`
does one of two things depending on which flags are given (the second is the per-repository
git hook `--git-hooks` installs), and neither is a subcommand of the other because a
subcommand would still need `--root` to make sense of `--git-hooks` while the machine-level
flags stay siblings of it rather than children.

`--home` and `--machine` are not test affordances bolted on afterwards: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
forbids a test from touching the developer's real `~/.claude` or `~/.config/stayfixed/`, and a
command whose only mode writes to the real ones could not be tested at all. Both default to the
real paths, exactly as `--root` defaults to the current directory elsewhere in this CLI.

`--approval-boundary` is a third thing, and the one that writes nothing: it prints the deny rule and
the sandbox settings that keep an agent's shell out of the trust record's directory, which are the
harness's to enforce and the person's to set (`trust.boundary` says why stayfixed sets none of
them), so it runs alone.

`--machine` is **not** gated behind an interactive shell here, unlike `attach`/`detach`'s. That
gate is about a flag that decides which overlay a *read* trusts; `setup` is the command that
*writes* the machine file in the first place, so gating its own `--machine` would refuse the
very thing this command exists to do, on every non-interactive run — including every scripted
check of the CLI's exit codes. Scoped to `attach`/`detach` on purpose, and left there.

# the `overlay` area's when that was written; it has since become the leaf module `runner.py`,
