"""`setup(preset, ...)`: machine setup, once — after stayfixed is installed, before any attach.

Five things, each reported and each independently skippable, in this order: write the machine
file (the personal defaults the preset names, for whichever of them nothing has recorded yet);
merge the preset's deny rules and the personal values into the machine-scope settings file;
only for the plugins the caller named, register the marketplace the preset declares and install
from it, per configured harness; report whether `stayfixed` itself resolves on `PATH`; and, only
when the caller named an answer, create, render or record the private overlay.

**A preset default never overwrites a value already recorded.** The first draft of this module
rebuilt `[personal]` from the preset's own defaults on every run, which meant a second
`setup --preset recommended` reset a personal value back to the preset's after the owner set it by
hand — exactly the value `setup.machine`'s own docstring promises survives a rewrite that "only
set one of them". `_new_personal_values` computes only the keys the machine file does not already
carry, and that is what `write_machine` receives — an empty dict on every run after the first,
once every key has a recorded value. The settings file's `pluginConfigs` follows the same rule
from its own side: a value it already holds is kept, whoever wrote it.

**A plugin is installed only when it is named.** A third-party plugin runs in every session of its
harness, its hooks included, and the preset pins none, so the preset only recommends them
(`[plugins] recommended`, which `init --questions` offers) and `setup --plugin NAME` installs one.

**Marketplaces are registered before anything is installed from them, and per-plugin sources are
never guessed.** The first draft attempted `claude plugin install superpowers@obra` on a fresh
machine and always failed there — `obra` and `upstash` are GitHub accounts, not marketplace names,
and every measured successful install in this tree's own spike record
(`docs/plans/2026-09-05-agent-harness-p0-spikes.md`) is preceded by a `marketplace add`. Checked
before writing this fix (`gh api repos/...`, `claude plugin marketplace list` on the machine this
was written on): `superpowers` and `context7` both ship in Anthropic's own official marketplace,
`anthropics/claude-plugins-official`, which a Claude Code install already carries — the
`marketplace add` this module still issues is idempotent defence in depth, not a first registration,
and its own real output confirms that (`✔ Marketplace 'claude-plugins-official' already on disk`).
No non-interactive, non-guessed source could be established for Codex, so nothing is attempted there
for these two plugins; the recommended preset's own `[plugins.claude]` table and the README carry
the reasoning and the recommendation respectively.

**Two harnesses, two verbs, and no unmeasured flags.** Claude Code installs a plugin with `claude
plugin install <name>@<marketplace>`, bare — the spike record's own transcript reports
`(scope: user)` as the *default* a bare install already gets, not something a flag adds, and `-y`
appears in that record only on `plugin uninstall`, never `install`. Codex adds one with
`codex plugin add <name>@<marketplace>` when a marketplace is declared for it — measured, not
assumed, in that same spike record. A harness or a plugin with no declared marketplace gets a note,
never a guessed argv.

**`pluginConfigs` and not a flat top-level key.** Claude Code's own settings reference files a
plugin's non-sensitive `userConfig` answers under `pluginConfigs[<plugin-id>].options`, keyed by
`<plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>` and not by the plugin name alone — confirmed against
`code.claude.com/docs/en/settings-reference` before this was written, because a flatter shape
would round-trip through nothing Claude Code itself reads. `PLUGIN_ID` matches this repository's
own shipped manifest and marketplace names (`tests/test_manifests.py`), which is the pair this
plugin is actually installed under everywhere the preset's own `setup` runs.

**The overlay is validated before anything is written**, in `_requested_overlay`, asked in
`_before_the_first_write` — above the machine file, the settings merge and the plugin installs,
and for `create:` above `gh repo create` itself:

* **a path holding something must be an overlay**, which is `overlay.api.require_overlay`: a tree
  whose identity record names layout 1. A path holding nothing (`fsops.vacant`: not there, or an
  empty directory this user can list and write) is rendered into, so a mistyped path is a new
  overlay and not a refusal, and the run that records a root other than the one the machine file
  held says so (`REPLACED_ROOT`).
* **a `create:` destination must be one `gh` can clone into**: vacant, or the overlay an
  earlier run made. Its place is `home/<name>`, knowable from the arguments
  (`overlay.api.target_root`), so a file there, or a directory holding anything but an overlay, is
  refused before `gh repo create` makes a repository on the owner's account that nothing would
  then record. Naming `create:` is the request, and no flag stands in front of it: a flag a
  model-written command line types as easily as the command consents to nothing.

Where the overlay lives is the owner's choice, and `setup` refuses no place for it: `doctor`'s
`overlay-requires` row warns when another repository's work tree holds it.

**The settings file is written through the home's own symlinks**, so a home managed by stow,
chezmoi or a synced directory gets the file its links lead to: nothing a repository writes is on
that path.

    Nothing is written, and no program is run, until every step has answered; each refuses with
    its own words, and the first refusal ends the run. The steps, in order:

    1. **What `--overlay` names** (`_requested_overlay`): a spec without both halves, a name that
       is not one path segment, a root the machine file cannot hold; for a path holding something,
       a tree that is not an overlay; for one holding nothing, a directory this user cannot render
       it in; and for `create:`, a destination `gh` could not clone into.
    2. **The preset** (`load_preset`): a mistyped `--preset`. It used to come one line after the
       home tree had been created for it.
    3. **Where a write under `--home` lands** (`_check_home_usable`): the settings file's
       directory, the `mkdir` of a home not there yet, and a `create:` destination not there yet.

    **The floor.** `fsops`' predicates raise rather than guess when a path cannot be asked
    about, and a step that does not word that itself let the `OSError` reach `cli.run` as
    `stayfixed: internal error`: a `create:` destination under a home nobody may search, or an
    `--overlay` directory below one. Whatever a step raises that way is a refusal here, naming
    the path that was being asked about — the `OSError`'s own file name, the path the predicate
    was handed — and the fault in `fsops.said`'s words. A step whose own words name the cause
    better keeps them.
