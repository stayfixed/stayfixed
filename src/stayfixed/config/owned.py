"""The four keys stayfixed rewrites inside a document somebody else owns.

`[stayfixed] version`, `[stayfixed] state`, `[stayfixed] enforced` and `[ci] ref` are stayfixed's to
rewrite (`docs/cli.md#configuration`). Every other key of `stayfixed.toml` is the user's, and so
is the file around them: its comments, its order, its blank lines. `tomllib` reads and nothing
in the standard library writes, and `tomlout.dumps` renders a whole document with the comments
gone, so this module edits lines.

**The read-back is the contract; the line editor is one implementation of it.** Each key is
edited and proved on its own: the text after the edit must parse to exactly the document before
it with that one key set to its value. The editor does not understand every shape: a dotted
key, a quoted key, an inline table, a value that is not a one-line string or a one-line array of
strings, a header-looking line inside a multi-line string. None of those ever yields a wrong
file; each yields an `OwnedKeyError` naming the key that failed and the line to write by hand.
stayfixed's own renderer never produces those shapes. A person may, and the refusal is the honest
answer to them. The proof covers values and not comments, because a comment is not part of the
parsed document: the editor keeps a line's trailing comment by pattern, and nothing proves it.

**What a message prints, and why that is safe.** The table and key come from `OWNED`. The value
is one stayfixed chose, rendered through `tomlout.quoted`: a version, a member of `STATES`, gate
names the loader has already held to `PROJECT_NAME`, or a sha the `release` package resolved from
the public repository's tags. A document that does not parse is answered with the parser's position
alone, as the loader answers it.
