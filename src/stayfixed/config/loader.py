"""Read stayfixed.toml, merge it under the preset, validate it.

The machine owner's layer is merged too (`config.owner`), so every command runs on the personal
values and session budgets the machine file sets, as a session does; a session resolves the
overlay's two files between the repository's and the machine file's over what this builds
(`config.session`, `config.overlay_layers`). The owner's layer is handed in, read once by the
command, which says on stderr what it read past (`command.command_owner`), or by a caller that
must go on (`config.session`); or, when the caller hands none in, read here, `strict`, refusing a
machine file that does not load and saying nothing of what it read past in one that does.
`loads` refuses what it cannot use; `loads_noting` reads what it can and says what it ignored or
reset. What the two loaders share is `config.reading`'s.

    has not written to disk yet, so the parse-and-validate half is this function on its own.
    `label` is what a refusal calls the document when it is not the file at `root`: the base's
    copy `stayfixed gate` reads out of git is validated against the tree's disk, and a refusal
    naming `<root>/stayfixed.toml` would send its owner to a file with nothing wrong in it.
    `personal` is the `[personal]` a load earlier in the same command already read, taken in
    place of reading the machine file again: a caller that holds a `Config` and not the path
    its machine file came from — a gate, handed `(root, config, base)` — loads a second
    document with it, and so reads no machine file but the one the command was given. Given
    both, `personal` wins and `machine` is never read. `owner` is the machine owner's layer

    (`config.owner.rebased`): its `personal` stands in for the machine file's, as `personal` does,

    document's; a command resolves it once, saying its notes there (`command.command_owner`), and

    For a reader that must go on, a session above all, where one name a newer release added or
    one value nobody can use would otherwise cost every setting the project made. An unknown
    section or key is removed with `UNKNOWN_NOTE`; the repository's `[personal]` goes through
    `classes.resolve`, which refuses the repository layer for every key in it, and is removed with
    its note. Then the document is built as `loads` builds it, and a refusal carrying
    a `key` — a `ConfigError`, or `validate_paths`' `PathEscape` — is decided before anything is
    removed, from the document and the preset alone:

    - a key the document holds that has a value to fall back to (`_stands_in`) — a preset value
      that holds in this repository, a schema default, a value the loader fills, or an entry that
      may simply be absent — is removed with `RESET_NOTE`, and the build is tried again;
    - a key the document does not hold, whose value was therefore the preset's, raises
      `UnusableKey` with `UNUSABLE_PRESET`;
    - a key the document holds with nothing to fall back to — a required key, a section holding
      one, a preset value that does not hold here either — raises `UnusableKey` at once.

    Nothing is removed that would leave the next attempt a required key to call missing, so no
    refusal is ever read against an earlier removal. Each retry removes one key the document
    holds and builds the whole document again, so the removals are bounded by what they cost as
    well as by their count: at most `NOTE_REMOVAL_LIMIT`, and at most `NOTE_REBUILT_LIMIT` over the
    length of `text`. The refusal that would remove one more raises `TooManyResets`, a refusal of
    the whole document. A refusal with no key is the whole document's and propagates, as a
    document that is not TOML does; a required key the document never wrote is one
    (`MissingKeys`). The owner's layer is folded in as `loads` folds it.
