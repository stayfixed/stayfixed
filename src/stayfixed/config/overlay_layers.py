"""The overlay's two layers of a session's preferences: `<overlay>/common/stayfixed.toml` for every
checkout, and `<overlay>/projects/<project>/stayfixed.toml` for a checkout this machine binds.

**The project comes from the binding record, never from the repository.** `binding.bound_project`
reads the id in the checkout's git common directory and this machine's record of it, so a clone
that commits the `[project] name` of one of the owner's projects has no project layer, and only
the common file applies to it. The overlay is the one `[overlay] root` of the machine file names
(`config.overlay.overlay_root`). The one exception is `attach` in a repository with no
`stayfixed.toml`, which names no project of its own: the project `attach` chose is read before the
binding records it (`read`'s `project`).

**Read the way a session reads `stayfixed.toml`, noting rather than refusing.** A name this
stayfixed does not read is ignored, and a value it cannot use is left out so the layer beneath
applies, each with a note naming the file and the key; a key whose class does not admit the
overlay's layers (`classes.ALLOWED`: a gate's input, a fact about the repository) is handed to
`classes.resolve`, which refuses it with its own note. A missing file, an overlay the machine
file does not record, a machine file `overlay_root` cannot read, and a git that cannot be asked
for the binding are each no layer and one note, never an exception: a session never dies of its
configuration (`config.session`). Every name and path a note carries is printed through
`stayfixed.printed`, since the overlay and the checkout wrote them.
