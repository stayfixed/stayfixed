"""What every reader of a configuration file shares: the refusals, the words for a document that
does not parse, the machine file's reader, and the checks of a value both layers apply.

Two loaders read configuration: `config.loader`, a repository's `stayfixed.toml` under its preset,
and `config.owner`, the machine owner's layer out of the machine file. The project loader builds
on the owner's layer, so the two meet here, below both, rather than one importing the other's
private names: a refusal is one type (`ConfigError`, and `MachineConfigError` for the machine
file), a document that does not parse is said in one set of words (`toml_position`), the machine
file is read once (`read_machine_toml`), and a value is held to its schema type by one rule
(`coerced`, `positive`, `schema_types`) whichever layer wrote it, against one answer for the keys a
table holds (`table_types`).

# package can raise is about a document somebody else wrote — a project's `stayfixed.toml`, the

# column M)"`, where `msg` embeds the source for at least five of its own faults: `Cannot
# declare ('x',) twice`, `Duplicate inline table key 'k'`, `Cannot redefine namespace k`,
# `Found invalid character 'c'`, `Cannot overwrite a value`. A TOML key is arbitrary quoted
# text, so interpolating the exception whole puts unbounded repository bytes into a refusal a
# skill is instructed to relay to a model. The position is the actionable half and it is
# stayfixed-shaped: two integers, or the parser's end-of-document form. Measured against CPython
# 3.11 and 3.12; the suffix is what `tomllib` appends, not what its `msg` says, so a `msg`
