"""Where the machine-level configuration lives; the file is optional.

**Neither variable that could name this file is read, and for one reason.** A committed
`.claude/settings.json` may carry an `env` block, which applies without a trust prompt in a
non-interactive session and can set `STAYFIXED_CONFIG`; Claude Code ignores `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
there (below), but direnv, mise or a devcontainer can set it from a file the repository commits.
So a repository able to redirect this path would declare its own overlay root and its own
pre-recorded trust hash — the two anchors that locating the note store and trusting in-repo
notes by hash rest on.

`STAYFIXED_CONFIG` was once gated and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` was not, which left the gate worth nothing:
the two variables reach the same file, and the second one costs a repository exactly one extra
path segment (`<dir>/stayfixed/config.toml` rather than the file itself). Gating one of a pair
of equivalent inputs is not a partial defence, it is a redirect with a longer name, so the
rule is the variable-independent one: **this file is `~/.config/stayfixed/config.toml` and
nothing else**, for every command and from a terminal too, so the file a person writes is the
file a hook reads; `--machine` names another, a path a person typed.

That is the XDG specification's own answer for an unset `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, so a machine owner
who sets one really does lose it rather than getting a wrong answer quietly, and
`stayfixed doctor`'s `ignored-env` row says so.

**`~` is `HOME`**, as the harness and every other program on the machine read it, so a
devcontainer, a home-manager setup or a test's scratch `HOME` keeps stayfixed and the harness
under one home. An environment that sets `HOME` already runs code as this user, so it holds this
file whichever home stayfixed read.
