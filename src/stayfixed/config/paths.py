"""Root containment for the `[paths]` fields, and for nothing else yet.

`validate_paths` iterates `config.paths.as_dict()`, so the guard covers exactly the fields of
`schema.Paths` and no others. Four path-shaped, repository-writable fields never reach
`contained()`: `ledger.code_roots`, `artifacts.local`, `memory.groups` and
`memory.index_extra`. A `stayfixed.toml` setting
`ledger.code_roots = ["../../../../etc", "/etc/passwd"]` loads without a murmur, while the same
strings under `[paths]` are refused. Until that changes, `stayfixed.ledger` and `stayfixed.memory`
must call `contained()` themselves on the fields they consume; widening the guard here would change
`Config`'s shape, so it belongs with the module that first reads those fields.

Two rules, not one: `PATH_VALUE` is the grammar half — what a value must match before it may be
printed anywhere, a report included — and `contained()` is the root half, deciding whether the
value may be written *here*. The same four unguarded fields above are unguarded by both.

**The component rule is `fsops`', and this module borrows it rather than restating it.**
`contained()` used to split the value with `Path(relative).parts`, which normalises an empty
component, a trailing slash and a leading `./` out of existence; `fsops` splits the raw string
and refuses all three. So `plan()` found nothing wrong with `docs//roadmap-history.md` and
`apply()` raised on it after ten artifacts and the manifest were already written, leaving a
repository `init` would not touch again. The two spellings agreed for four review rounds, which
is what a duplicated rule does until it does not.
`checked_components` is the single spelling now; the import goes subpackage-to-leaf, so `fsops`
stays the leaf the hook path depends on it being.
