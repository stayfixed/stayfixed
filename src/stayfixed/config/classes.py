"""One class per configuration key, the layers that may set each class, and `resolve`.

A value reaches a session from one of several layers — the preset, the repository's
`stayfixed.toml`, the overlay's common, per-project and per-machine files, and the machine file
— and whether a layer may set a key is a property of the key, not of the layer that happens
to write it. So every key has one class (`CLASSES`), and every class names the layers it admits
(`ALLOWED`). `resolve` applies that over a stack of layers: a layer the class does not admit
contributes nothing and says so, and of the rest the highest in `ORDER` wins, or a `merge` the
caller names folds them lowest first, with the layer each value came from.

What `resolve` decides today is who may set a key, and where a value came from; it is not yet
what builds a session's values. It builds the owner's layer (`config.owner`, from the preset and
the machine file), refuses a repository's machine-only keys for the NOTE load
(`config.loader`), and gives `doctor`'s `preferences` row each value's layer; the project's
`Config` is still built by `config.loader`, which merges the repository's file over the preset
and folds the owner's layer in.

The keys are dotted, `section.key`, and a section wildcard `section.*` covers every key of its
section; `tests/config/test_classes.py` holds every field of `Config`'s sections to a row, so a
field added to the schema has a class before anything may set it (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
"Configuration").
