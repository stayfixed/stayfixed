"""What a session runs on: the project's configuration, read the way a session must, and the owner's
layer.

A session never dies of its configuration. A command refuses a `stayfixed.toml` it cannot use whole,
because a person is about to act on it; a hook has no person to tell, and a `PreToolUse` that
refused because a file did not load would stop every tool call for something no guard decided. So
`session_config` answers for anything the repository or the machine file holds, and says what it
could not use in one warning, which `SessionStart` shows (`hooks.dispatch`):

- no `stayfixed.toml`: no project configuration, and nothing to say;
- one that is a symbolic link, is not UTF-8, cannot be read or is not TOML: no project
  configuration, and `FALLBACK_WARNING`;
- one longer than a session reads (`SESSION_READ_LIMIT`), read no further: no project
  configuration, and `TOO_LARGE_WARNING`;
- one holding more settings it cannot use than the NOTE load removes (`loader.NOTE_REMOVAL_LIMIT`,
  and fewer for a long file, `loader.NOTE_REBUILT_LIMIT`): no project configuration, and
  `TOO_MANY_WARNING`;
- one whose key cannot be used and has nothing to stand in for it — a required key, or a section
  holding one, that the document got wrong or never wrote, or a preset value that does not hold in
  this repository — no project configuration, and `UNUSABLE_WARNING` naming the key;
- one that loads with notes (`loader.loads_noting`): the configuration, and `NEWER_RELEASE_WARNING`
  when its `[stayfixed] version` is later than the running one, `NOTED_WARNING` otherwise.

The owner's layer is resolved, not `strict`, whatever the project holds, so the guards run on the
preset and the machine file in every one of those cases, and a machine file that could not be used
whole adds `MACHINE_FILE_WARNING`. Every warning is a constant in stayfixed's own words: it
reaches the model, so the one value of the repository's it carries, a key, is printed through
`printed.printable`.

**One resolution builds the session's preferences.** The keys a layer above the repository may
set (`RESOLVED`: the personal values, the guards' switches, the preferences and the session
budgets) are resolved once, by `classes.resolve`, over the preset, what the repository's file
holds after the NOTE load, the overlay's common and project files (`config.overlay_layers`) and
the machine file, and `Config`'s values for them come from that resolution
(`SessionConfig.resolution`), as do the guards (`SessionConfig.guards`). Its notes are what the
overlay's files could not give and what `resolve` refused; no warning carries them, and
`doctor`'s `preferences` row names them.

# A named cap: the most bytes of `stayfixed.toml` a session reads. A hook has the ten seconds
# `hooks/hooks.json` gives each entry, and a `PreToolUse` hook that runs past them loses its guard,
# so what the parse and the NOTE load cost,
# each in proportion to the file, is bounded by the file before either starts: a 2.8 MB file of
# custom gates kept a hook fourteen seconds, and at 1 MiB the costliest file a session read took 6
# to 7.5 s of CPU on a laptop's efficiency cores. A `stayfixed.toml` that `init` writes is a few
# hundred bytes, and one that spells out every setting and a few dozen gates is a few kilobytes;
# 256 KiB is still dozens of times the second, and the costliest file of that length takes 0.25 s
