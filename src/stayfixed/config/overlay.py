"""Which overlay root the machine file records: one key of a file the core owns.

The overlay itself is the private layer's, and this module reads nothing of it: only
`[overlay] root`, the machine file's record of where it is, which the note store, `attach`,
`doctor` and `init --questions` all ask for. Beside `config.reading` rather than in
`config.machine`, because `config.reading` is what reads the file (`read_machine_toml`), for this
reader and the owner's layer alike.

    `None` means **not recorded**, and nothing else: the message the note store prints for it is
    "no overlay root is recorded in the machine configuration; run `stayfixed setup`", which is
    wrong advice for a broken file.

    So a file that cannot be read or parsed raises `config.reading`'s `MachineConfigError`, in its
    words for the same file (`read_machine_toml`), and the three shapes that genuinely
    record no overlay answer `None`: an absent file (the ordinary state before `setup` has run),
    no `[overlay]` table, and a table with no usable `root`.

    With no file named, the file is the one no variable can move (`machine_config_path`): the
    root anchors where the note store may resolve, and a committed `.claude/settings.json` can
    set a variable in a session no person is watching. A machine with no home
    (`config.machine.owner_home`) has no such file, and records no overlay.
