"""The machine owner's layer: personal values, the guards' switches and the session budgets.

The preset's `[defaults.personal]`, `Guards()` and no session budget, overridden by the machine
file's `[personal]`, `[guards]` and `[budgets]`, resolved through `classes.resolve` as the layers
`PRESET` and `MACHINE_FILE`. The machine file is the owner's, never a repository's
(`config.machine` says where it is), so it is the one place a guard may be switched
off; a repository's `[guards]` is a layer `classes.ALLOWED` does not admit.

Two readers ask, and they differ only over a file that does not load. A command the owner runs
refuses it (`strict`, which every load of a command asks for), as `config.overlay.overlay_root`
refuses it; a session must go on, and the preset's values stand in, with `MACHINE_FILE_NOTE`, and
the refusal is kept (`Owner.unloaded`), so `doctor` can say that every command refuses the file
the session read past. In a file that loads, an unknown key, a gate's budget or an unusable value
costs that key alone, with a note, for both: what the owner sets is honoured, and what this
stayfixed cannot use is said and never a block. Refused, a key a later release's `setup` writes
would stop every older command on the machine — the CLI and the plugin's hooks are easily two
versions — over a key none of them reads, and no boundary rests on the refusal: no repository
writes this file. A command says the notes on stderr (`said_on_stderr`), once, where it resolves
the layer, and hands that layer to every load it makes (`rebased` stands it on the preset each
document names), so the machine file is read once a command and no note is said twice. Every
sentence names the file and the key — the key through `printed.clipped`, since a TOML key is any
quoted text — and never a value.
