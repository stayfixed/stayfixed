# globals at runtime, so a type imported only under `TYPE_CHECKING` would break the loader.

# The one grammar for a name stayfixed answers to: a project, a profile, an overlay owner, a

# and all. A TOML key is arbitrary quoted

# typed, and each reaches a git ref, an output line or a YAML file GitHub executes, where quoting
# alone would still admit a newline. Inside that character set it refuses what git's own
# branch-name rules refuse (`git check-ref-format --branch`), so nothing names a branch no
# repository can have: `..`, `//`, a component starting with `.`, a component ending in `.lock`,
# a trailing `/` or `.`, and the name `HEAD` itself. `@{` and `-` at the start are outside the
