"""Read a JSON document as an object, within the reach of this interpreter's parser.

One reader and not one per caller. The settings engine (`scaffold.entries`), `attach`'s reader of
the settings file it merges into and its reader of the ledger it wrote each parse a document a
clone may have committed, and each must answer every way that parse can fail as its own refusal:
a parse failure that escapes as a bare exception passes every caller's catch and ends a command
as an internal error, or turns a `doctor` row into "this check could not run".

Two of those ways are valid JSON rather than malformed JSON, and `json.loads` gives neither a
`JSONDecodeError`: a document nested past what the parser follows raises `RecursionError` on
every supported Python, and an integer literal longer than the interpreter converts (4,300
digits by default) a plain `ValueError`. The caller may refuse those as a kind of their own —
the settings engine does, because a harness whose parser has no such limit reads the document,
and may run the hooks in it — and words them in its own voice where its sentence says more than
what the parser met. The interpreter's own message is never used for either: it tells the reader
to raise a limit.

A leaf module: it imports nothing from `stayfixed`, so the core and a delivery area both reach it
without paying for an area.

# today, and 3.14 refuses what 3.13 refuses, in the same words; more than twice under where 3.14's
# `==` stops, though on 3.14 those limits follow the stack size and shrink under a smaller
# `ulimit -s`. It is not 3.12's indenting encoder's reach, near 994 levels: `json_text` answers
# that one where it is met. No shipped file states it: a settings file nests five levels.
