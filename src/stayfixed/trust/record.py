"""The machine's one trust record: `trust.json`, beside the machine file, as a versioned document.

A version-1 record is a JSON object with two keys, `version` and `approvals`, and each approval
names its kind, its subject, the digest approved and when it was recorded:

    {"approvals": [{"approved_at": "2026-10-16T09:30:00+00:00", "digest": "…",
                    "kind": "memory", "subject": "/home/me/project/.stayfixed/memory"}],
     "version": 1}

**Absent and unreadable are not the same answer.** An absent file is the ordinary state of a fresh
machine and holds no approval. A file that is there and is not a version-1 record — not JSON, not
UTF-8, a later version, no version, an approval missing a field — refuses with
`UnreadableTrust`, and nothing here overwrites it: it holds every project's approval on the
machine, and reading it as empty would let the next write persist the loss.

Every write replaces the whole file through `fsops` in one atomic step. No lock is taken: two
writers at once each replace the file whole, the last one wins, and neither leaves it torn.
