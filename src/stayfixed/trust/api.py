"""The trust package's import surface: the machine's one record of approvals.

A person lists and revokes approvals through `stayfixed trust`, whose commands are this package's
own. The `memory` area keeps its reviewed notes in the record under kind `reviewed`, with no
approval kind registered for it: it reads `recorded`, with the `Approval` it answers in and the
`UnreadableTrust` it refuses with, and `memory promote` writes through `approve_all`. A consumer
that needs another reader or writer grows this list in a commit that names it.

`setup --approval-boundary` prints what keeps an agent's shell out of the record, and writes none
of it (`boundary`): `record_deny_rules` over the directory `record_path` names, `SANDBOX_ON` for
the user settings, and `ENFORCING_SETTINGS` for `managed_named`'s file. `sandbox_refused` is how
`setup` tells a write an agent's sandbox refused; `SANDBOX_REFUSED` is the one sentence every
writer gives such a write, `setup`'s as the record's, and `RUN_OUTSIDE` the remedy it gives in it.
