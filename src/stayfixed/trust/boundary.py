"""What keeps an agent from writing the trust record itself, which is the harness's to keep.

An approval holds against repository bytes: stayfixed never writes `trust.json` from them, and a
clone, a pull or a pull request does not reach it, since it lies under the home the password
database records, outside every repository. A repository whose hooks the harness runs (a committed
`.claude/settings.json` hook in a folder the person trusted) is code running as that person, and
writes any file they can, the record included. Against an agent whose shell can write that file,
an approval holds nothing: the terminal check `trust approve` makes is a speed bump (`kinds`'
docstring says why), and stayfixed neither enforces nor checks anything stronger. What stops such
an agent is the harness's own sandbox, configured by the person: under Claude Code, its sandbox,
which confines what the shell tool writes, and a `permissions.deny` rule over the record's
directory, which the sandboxed shell and the file tools both honour. `setup --approval-boundary`
prints both for the person to set, and writes nothing. This module holds the spellings it prints,
and nothing here reads or writes a file.

Every literal below was measured on Claude Code 2.1.296 (macOS) on 2026-10-16; the record is the
findings at the end of the 2026-10-15 floor, layers and trust plan in `docs/plans/`.

- **The sandbox.** A project's `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` setting
  `sandbox.enabled = false` turns a user's `sandbox.enabled = true` off for that project. The
  sandbox is admin-required, and then a repository's `false` is ignored, where
  `sandbox.allowUnsandboxedCommands = false` is set in managed settings or, unless managed settings
  set it `true`, in a file or JSON passed to Claude Code's own `--settings` flag on each start
  (the sandboxing reference; the flag was read there and not measured). The advice names managed
  settings, which hold on every start without a flag.
- **The rule.** `Edit(//<absolute path>/**)` stopped a sandboxed shell write and a file-tool write
  into that directory; one leading slash anchors the path at the working directory and stopped
  neither outside it, and a `Write(...)` rule stopped neither in any spelling.
- **Where an administrator's settings live:** `MANAGED_SETTINGS`.

**A write the sandbox refuses** (`sandbox_refused`): with Claude Code's sandbox on, an agent's shell
writes only the working directory and the temporary directory, so stayfixed's own writes to the
machine directory -- the trust record, the machine file -- and to the user settings fail there with
a permission error, whether or not the deny rule is in place. Claude Code's sandboxing reference
gives the error for such a write: `Operation not permitted` (`EPERM`) on macOS, and `Read-only file
system` (`EROFS`) on Linux and WSL2. macOS's was also measured here (with `sandbox-exec` on macOS 27
on 2026-10-16: an open and a `mkdir` in a denied directory each raised `PermissionError` `EPERM`);
Linux's was not. So `EPERM` and `EROFS` are read as that refusal, and every writer says so in one
sentence, `SANDBOX_REFUSED`, naming a person outside the agent's sandbox as the one to make the
write. A read-only mount and an immutable flag answer the same, so the two commands a person runs
again, `setup` and the trust record's writers, give the remedy `RUN_OUTSIDE`, which ends with
`OWN_TERMINAL_TOO`, lest a person already in their own terminal be sent there again. A directory
whose mode refuses the user answers `EACCES`, which is not the sandbox, and keeps each writer's
sentence naming the directory.
