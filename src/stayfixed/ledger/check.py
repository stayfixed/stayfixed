    point configured (`_fork_register`, bound once by `register_gate`). Read at the tree's paths,
    a change that moved the ledger by `[paths]` found nothing there at the fork, so it could
    delete an entry in the same change and pass. A register no configuration builds is read at
    its own paths at every commit (`locate` is `None`).

    Those commits are `git merge-base --all <base> HEAD`, every best common ancestor, the ones
    `plan` diffs against too. What the base gained after the change forked is not the change's to
    have kept, so a branch behind its base is not blamed for an entry filed since; and what the
    change forked with, it still answers for, on a stale branch as on the merge commit CI checks
    out, whose base parent the base can have moved past. A history the change shapes itself can
    give it several merge bases, and the one `merge-base` alone answers, the newest by date, can

    relative to `root`, and their entries are united. Entries are append-only, so on a base that
    kept its entries the union refuses no branch that deleted nothing; an entry removed from the
    base itself, by a direct push, is still named on a branch whose merge bases include one from
    before the removal, and is restored on the base.

    A base shaped like an option is refused, as `plan check` refuses it. Fork points
    `gitenv.fork_points` cannot name — a base git cannot resolve, one that shares no commit with
    HEAD, a shallow clone, and one git cannot say is shallow or not — and a listing git does not
    give, are a `Failure` — "could not run" to a gate — and never "the base has no ledger",
