"""`stayfixed bugs regressions`: run each fixed entry's `regression` through `prove`.

Which statuses run, and why the run is a convenience and not a control, `docs/cli.md`'s
`stayfixed bugs regressions` says, once.

Each argv runs as `prove` runs a command, from the project root, under the caller's environment,
with `[gates] custom_timeout_seconds` as its bound, the bound a project already sets for its own
gates; and every receipt is judged as `prove` judges it, so an argv no runner adapter recognises is
`not proven` and nothing is started for it.
