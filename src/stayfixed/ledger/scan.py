"""One traversal for the three readers of ledger identifiers.

`code_mentions` reports a dangling identifier, `entry_citations` reports a citation of an entry
file that is not there, and `renumber`'s sweep rewrites both. They have to agree on what a
scannable file is, so every exclusion lives here: each time one reader held an exclusion of its
own, the pair disagreed and something was lost (a fixture the scan skipped as binary was an
unswept file to the sweep; a fixture-holding test file the scan skipped was rewritten by the
sweep while `check` reported OK over the red suite it had just created).

Git enumerates the candidates wherever it can — the question both readers ask is "what is in
the commit under review", and a walk answers a different one — and the walk is the fallback for
a root that is not the top of a checkout. Symlinks are skipped whole. A file is read once, here,
and handed to every reader as text: the readers never open a file themselves.

Where to look is the project's (`config`: the code roots and the `[paths]` values); what to look
for is the register's — its directory, its index and its identifiers.
