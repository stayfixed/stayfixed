"""The private overlay's rows in `stayfixed doctor`: `pre-commit` and `overlay-requires`.

Both are about this machine's overlay rather than about the project, and the overlay is this
area's: it renders the overlay, declares the floor `overlay-requires` judges, and ships the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` whose installation `pre-commit` asks about. `doctor`'s core discovers
this module by name (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Areas") and imports nothing of this area.

The overlay root is the core's answer, `Context.overlay_root`, which the report resolves at most
once for every row that reads it, so both rows read one answer and nothing one run resolved
reaches the next.

Every import sits inside a function body, as in a `hooks.py`: this module is imported by
discovery, and a module-level import here would be one more thing every `doctor` run loads
before it has asked anything.

    sentences.

    The argument is the root rather than the `Context`, so that the caller's own

    Both arms are a `skip` and neither reaches the exit code. The remedy is the difference, and
    it follows `Check`'s rule rather than the row's status: "no overlay recorded" is the ordinary
    state of a machine that has not run `stayfixed setup`, and no command in this row's gift
    changes it; a root that is recorded and is not there is a fault on this machine that nothing
