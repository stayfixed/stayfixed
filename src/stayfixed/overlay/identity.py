"""Is this directory an overlay? One answer, for every command that has to ask.

**What an overlay is, for the purpose of recording one.** A tree whose identity record,
`stayfixed-overlay.toml` at its root (`layout.IDENTITY_RECORD`), parses and names layout 1: the
file the shipped template writes and the one thing every overlay carries. It replaced the plugin
manifests an overlay carried while it was a plugin of its own; an overlay made before the record
shipped is refused with the record to add named in full, since no code migrates one.

It is a *structural* probe and not a security boundary: a repository that wants to look like an
overlay can commit the record. What it buys is that the ordinary accidents stop — a mistyped
path, a project directory, the stayfixed checkout, somebody else's repository — before `setup`
records the tree or `overlay upgrade` writes the template into it.

**Nothing a repository authored is quoted back.** The record's bytes come from a directory this
process was pointed at, and a repository is untrusted input (principle 5), so the refusal says
which file failed and what it had to hold, never what it held.
