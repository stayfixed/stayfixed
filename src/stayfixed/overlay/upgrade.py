"""Refresh an overlay after a release, and name the two files nobody may refresh silently.

The refresh itself is the scaffold engine's, unchanged: an untouched skeleton file is updated,
a hand-edited one is skipped and named, and the oracle is the digest the manifest recorded. An
overlay is where the owner's own rules live, so a silent overwrite here destroys the only copy
of something — which is exactly why this module calls the engine rather than reimplementing the
rule.

**Why a wrapper type rather than a bare `Plan`.** An upgrade gives two files an exception to the
hash rule: `common/claude/permissions.json` and `common/claude/hooks.json` are named *regardless
of hash*, because they are the two that can grant capability and a hash match is not consent
for those. The scaffold engine's `Plan` has no verb for "needs a decision", and that contract is
shared by every area that scaffolds, so the answer is a type *around* the plan rather than a new
`Verb` inside it.

**What `decisions` actually is, stated plainly because an earlier account of it was not.** The
write is **unconditional**: `apply()` runs before `decisions` is computed, so there is no moment
at which a decision could be taken and nothing here waits on one. `decisions` is a *post-hoc
notice* — these two files were refreshed, go and look at them — and not a gate.

That is safe for exactly one reason, and it is a property of the shipped template rather than of
this function: the template cannot grant anything. `common/claude/permissions.json` ships a
`permissions` table with no rule in it at all and `common/claude/hooks.json` is `{"hooks": {}}`,
held by `tests/overlay/test_template.py::test_the_template_ships_no_allow_rule_anywhere`,
`::test_the_template_ships_permissions_that_are_neither_granted_nor_pretended` and
`::test_the_template_ships_no_hook_entry`, the first with a mutation behind it. So refreshing
either file can widen nothing, and a notice is enough.

The permissions file used to ship two `deny` rules, and this paragraph used to call it
"deny-only" as though that were the reason it was inert. It was not: `attach.permissions`
reads `permissions.allow` and never `permissions.deny`, so those two rules reached nothing, and
the live copy of that protection is `presets/recommended.toml`'s `[deny] global`, which `setup`
merges into `<home>/.claude/settings.json`. The file is inert because it grants nothing, which
is the property this argument actually needs.

**It stops being enough the day a third capability file lands** — or the day one of those two
ships a non-empty body. A change that adds one has to move the ask in front of `apply()`, or give
the caller a way to decline; this paragraph is the record that the current shape depends on the
template being inert, and not on the order of the two statements below.

    """What a release would change in this overlay, and which files the caller is told to read.

    **`root` is checked to be an overlay before anything is planned, let alone written.** It was
    checked nowhere: in a directory holding a `README.md` and a `src/main.py`, `overlay upgrade
    --root .` created every shipped file but one — both manifests, `hooks/hooks.json`,
    `common/**`, `.gitignore` and `.github/workflows/scan.yml` among them; `README.md` was
    skipped only because that directory had one — reported them as work done and exited 0.
    (The measurement was taken when the tree shipped fifteen files; `OVERLAY_FILES` is the
    count today, which is why the refusal above derives it rather than spelling it.) Writing
    a workflow file into a repository the owner may then commit is the concrete harm, and
    `--root` defaulting to `.` is what made it a plausible typo rather than an exotic one. The
    probe is `identity.require_overlay`, the same one `setup --overlay` records a root through:
    one question, asked one way, in the one module that knows what an overlay is.

    The files a release no longer ships (`template.retired`) are planned beside the shipped
    ones, so a copy that still holds what stayfixed wrote there is removed, and any other copy is
    kept and named. Each directory above a file the run removed then goes once it is empty
    (`fsops.rmdir_parents_within`), whether or not `apply` finished: a later run cannot tell a
    directory this one emptied from one a person left empty, so it would never remove one. A
    removed file is one an action unlinks that was there before `apply` and is not after it; a
    removal whose file was already gone empties nothing, and the directories above it stay.

    `decisions` is computed after `apply()` and names the two capability files unconditionally;
    it is a notice, not a gate. The module docstring says why that is safe here and what would
    make it unsafe.

    `project.name` is the instance's directory name and goes nowhere: the engine reads
    `stayfixed.profile` and `artifacts.local` out of a `Config` and nothing else. It is passed
    because a `Config` has to be complete, not because an overlay is a project.
