"""Create the owner's private overlay: generated on GitHub, or rendered here.

Two sources, one result, both reached through `stayfixed setup --overlay`. `generate` asks GitHub
to generate a private repository from a public template and clone it — the owner's own
`<owner>/stayfixed-overlay-template` when they have published one, and the publisher's
otherwise; `render` renders `templates/overlay/` at a path through the scaffold engine, makes a
git repository of it, and touches no network. A template and not a fork: a fork's visibility is
bound to the upstream network and cannot be made private, and an overlay that is not private is
the one outcome this whole area exists to prevent.

`finish` is what every overlay `setup` makes or records runs next: it installs the commit-time
secret scan, and writes nothing into the tree, so the identity record stays the bytes the template
shipped and `overlay upgrade` can refresh it. Generating is idempotent — `gh` may give up on the
clone with the repository already created, so a second run is the ordinary case rather than the
exception — and so is `finish`.

A render writes its identity record last and a clone ordinarily does (`layout.OVERLAY_FILES` says
when not), each into nothing or an empty directory (`fsops.vacant`), and every refusal after `gh
repo create` ends in `UNRECORDED`.
