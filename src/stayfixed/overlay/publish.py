"""Publish the overlay template repository from the owner's checkout.

Render `templates/overlay/` into a scratch directory, strip the scaffold ledger (a repository
generated from a template carries none, and publishing one would make every generated overlay
read as hand-edited to `overlay upgrade`), make sure the repository exists, is public and is
marked as a template, clone it, replace its tree with the render, commit, and — only with
`yes` — push. Everything that leaves this process goes through `Runner`, so a test asserts the
argv and never reaches GitHub.

**`yes` gates everything outward-facing**, which is three acts and not one: the repository's
creation, its template flag, and the push. Without it the command renders, asks `gh` what
exists — a read — and reports what it would create, mark and push. That is the dry run; there
is no separate `--dry-run` flag, because a second way to say the same thing is a second thing
to get wrong. The first draft of this ran `gh repo create --public` before the gate, so the
documented dry run created a public repository on the owner's account.

**It runs from the owner's authenticated checkout by design.** The public repository's CI
holds no credential that can write a second repository, so this is not a workflow and never
becomes one. `gh` decides the protocol and carries the token; this module only names the argv.
