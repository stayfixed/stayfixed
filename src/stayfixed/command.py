"""What every configured command shares: the common flags and the configuration load.

Three areas register commands that take `--root` and `--machine` and then load
`stayfixed.toml`; at three the convention is code. So is the machine owner's layer every load of a
command runs on (`command_owner`), resolved once a command and said once. Not in
`stayfixed.areas`: that module is imported by the hook registry, and
`tests/boundaries/test_discovery.py` asserts that discovery in a clean interpreter imports neither
the configuration layer nor the presets — this module imports the loader at module level and is
imported only by `commands.py` modules.
