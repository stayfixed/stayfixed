"""What a `doctor` row is made of, and what an area hands the report to add rows of its own.

The vocabulary lives here rather than in `checks.py` because two kinds of module speak it: the
core's checks in `checks.py` and `entries.py`, and an area's own `doctor.py`, which
`registry.contributions` discovers by name and which reaches this module through `doctor/api.py`.
`checks.py` is the core's checks and the run; this module is the shapes they share and the one
answer every area reads alike, the overlay root (`Context.overlay_root`), so it imports nothing of
any area. `REPORT_THIS` is here too: the run's guard in `checks.py` and the rows `registry.py`
builds for an area that could not contribute both give it, and it is a remedy, part of what a row
is made of, rather than anything of the run's or of discovery's.
