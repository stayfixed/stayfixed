"""`doctor`: what an installation looks like from the outside.

This area **reports and never repairs.** Every other area in this package writes something;
this one reads.

**Every subprocess a report runs only asks.** This area's own are stayfixed's hook wrapper with
`--version`, and `git ls-remote --exit-code` over the public repository's tags, which is how
`[ci] ref` is judged; the rows the areas contribute ask `git` questions of their own, inside those
areas. None of them writes, and only the `ci-ref` row's `git ls-remote` leaves this machine, which
is why it alone goes through the `Runner` seam, under a bound of its own
(`checks.CI_REF_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). How many a report launches is a measurement and not this
package's to state: `docs/cli.md` gives it, and
`tests/test_install_path.py::test_doctor_launches_the_number_of_subprocesses_it_says_it_does`
pins it.

**Two of the core's rows read something the environment named, and neither trusts it.** `wrapper`
executes only the plugin root this process derived from its own module path, because a root a
variable named is a script a repository can choose (`checks.plugin_root`); `diagnostics` reads
the sink's log through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` and prints a count and not one byte of it,
because nothing here can establish who wrote that file (`checks._diagnostics`).

A check that cannot be answered says `skip` and names what a measurement would need, because a
check that returned green because it could not look would be strictly worse than one that admits
it. A skip is either a question no build can answer or a state of the machine or of the
repository, and it carries a remedy when the skip is itself worth acting on (`model.Check`); when
`stayfixed.toml` is missing or will not load, the first row says so and every other row skips
against it. A skip never reaches the exit code (`doctor/commands.py`). Which rows skip, and on
what, is `docs/cli.md`'s census.
