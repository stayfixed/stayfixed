"""The `doctor` command: report an installation, and exit non-zero when one is broken.

One command and not a group, the shape `docs/cli.md` documents and the shape the skill already
invokes.

**A `skip` is not a finding.** A check this build cannot answer at all — the hash Codex keys hook
trust on, which no spike has measured — skips on every installation, so an exit code that counted
skips would make `doctor` red on every correct one. Every other skip is a state of the machine or
of the repository, and which of those states is the ordinary one can move with things no code
here decides — whether a released tag exists for `init` to record as `[ci] ref`, say — so nothing
in this module asserts how many rows skip, or which: that census is `docs/cli.md`'s, and whether a
skip carries a remedy is `model.Check`'s rule. Exit 1, the findings exit code, is reserved for
`red`, and `warn` does not reach it either: a budget lowered below the preset is a correct state
somebody should still see.

**The remedies live in `--json` and never in the summary.** Every command's summary is one
line, and a report's remedies do not fit in one; the skill relays each remedy verbatim from the
report, so a remedy absent from `--json` is a remedy the user never sees. The summary renders
through `findings.listed`, which caps at `LISTED_LIMIT`, because an unbounded list of row names
pushes the repairing command off the end of the line.

**`--machine` is not gated behind an interactive shell here**, unlike `attach`/`detach`'s. That
gate is about a flag deciding which overlay a *write* trusts; `doctor` writes nothing, and
gating it would make the report unable to answer about the machine file a caller just named.
