"""How the report finds the rows the areas contribute, and what an area that cannot gets instead.

Every `stayfixed.<area>.doctor` is discovered by name (`discover_contributors`), its `register()`
is asked under a guard, and every way an area's contribution can fail costs one red row named
after the area and never the report (`contributions`). None of it is a check: it is the one
failure policy for an area's own code and the seam a test replaces to inject an area, so it is
kept apart from the core's checks, and a test patches `discover_contributors` here, where
`contributions` reads it. It imports nothing of `checks.py`: the core's checks reach it as
`contributions`' argument, whose names no area may repeat, so `checks.py` imports this module
for the run without a cycle.
