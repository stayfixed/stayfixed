"""The release package's import surface: everything code outside it may import from it.

What stays here is what an installed stayfixed reads about its own releases. The repository's
release tooling — the version check, the changelog and the pin — is `scripts/release.py`, which
is not shipped as a command and imports from here like any other consumer.

`Pin`, `Resolution`, `released`, `resolve_pin` and `is_released` are published for `init`, which
writes the pin, `doctor`'s `ci-ref` row, which judges it, and `stayfixed gate`, which admits a
moved `[ci] ref` only at a released commit (`is_released`) — all ask this package because "which
commit is release X" is its own question. `released` is published so the row can ask the remote
once for the sha and the alias both. `tag_for` is published for the release script, whose
`check --tag` holds a tag to the tree's version by the same spelling the pin is looked up by,
and for `scripts/publish_plugin.py`, which holds the tag's `plugin.json` version to the tag by
it. `PACKAGE` is published with it: the name the platform's tag carries is the name the release
script looks the package up by in `uv.lock` and the marketplace entry by, and
`scripts/plugin_tree.py` reads the pin from the marketplace entry of that name, so one constant
is how the three stay one name.
