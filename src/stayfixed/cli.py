    An area registers a command as `add_parser(name, help=...)`, and argparse keeps that
    sentence for the *parent's* listing only: the command's own `--help` opened with `usage:`
    and went straight to the options, with nothing about what the command does. The one
    sentence each area already wrote becomes the command's description here, so no area has to
    spell it twice. The `--json` epilog rides along for the same reason it is on the root.

    The group listing is sorted because discovery is by area and registration within one, so
    `bugs` (from `ledger`) landed between `hook` and `memory`; `discover_registrars` says "in
    name order", and that is now true of what the user sees and not only of the modules.
