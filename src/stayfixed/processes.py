"""Ending a command's whole process group, in the one order that cannot end an unrelated one.

A command stayfixed runs for a project, a `[gates.custom]` gate or a test command `prove` runs,
starts in a session of its own, so what it starts shares its process group, and that group is
ended however the command finishes: exit, timeout or interrupt. A descendant that leaves the
group (a new session, or a job-control shell's own group) is not reached, and nor is one stayfixed
may not signal (a sudo or setuid descendant). A timeout or an interrupt ends the group with
SIGTERM first (`end`), so a command that ends such a descendant on it, as `stayfixed prove` ends
its runner, can; then SIGKILL.

The group's id is the command's pid, so the order is the point: the exit is watched without
reaping (`exited`), the group is ended (`kill_group`), and only then is the command reaped, while
its pid is still taken and so names no group but its own.
