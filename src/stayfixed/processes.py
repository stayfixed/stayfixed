"""Ending a command's whole process group, in the one order that cannot end an unrelated one.

A command stayfixed runs for a project, a `[gates.custom]` gate or a test command `prove` runs,
starts in a session of its own, so what it starts shares its process group, and that group is
ended however the command finishes: exit, timeout or interrupt. A descendant that leaves the
group (a new session, or a job-control shell's own group) is not reached, and nor is one stayfixed
may not signal (a sudo or setuid descendant).

The group's id is the command's pid, so the order is the point: the exit is watched without
reaping (`exited`), the group is ended (`kill_group`), and only then is the command reaped, while
its pid is still taken and so names no group but its own.
