"""`stayfixed prove`: run a test command where it is typed, count only its runner's report, and
say what that proves.

What `prove` does, in order. `guards.api.read_launch` reads the command past its assignments,
`env` and `uv run …` (the launch), and the first runner adapter that recognises what is left plans
the run. The command is launched in the directory it is typed in, never in the top-level, and is
judged in the directory it runs in (`moved`): the one its launcher moves it to (`uv run
--directory`, `UV_WORKING_DIR`), else that same directory. The adapter plans from it, the project
it answers for is its git top-level, or the directory itself outside a repository, and the
receipt names it. Every `NAME=value` the launch holds, before its launcher or after an `env`, is
an assignment of the command: one the adapter's `forging` set says forges (a variable it names,
set to a value its test says shapes the report) is `refused` before anything is planned. One that
stands right after a launcher, with no `env` between (`uv run FOO=1 pytest`), is the launcher's
program as typed, which runs no test: the command is `not proven` (`not-recognised`). The run's
environment is built once: the caller's, less every inherited variable the adapter's `forging` set
says forges, then the command's own assignments in order, the last of two for one name winning,
as a shell builds it. The adapter plans in that environment, finding its program on its
`PATH` (`stayfixed.profiles.programs`), and the command runs in it. The adapter is handed the
launcher's words alone, never an assignment or an `env`, and keeps them in front of the command as
typed. The plan names the argv to execute, where the report arrives and in which format, and the
globs of the files that shape the report. The tree's state is taken and the command runs in a
session of its own; then the report is counted, the tree's state is taken again, and `CASCADE`
says what the run proved. The plan's scratch directory, made outside the project and readable by
its owner alone, is removed on every path.

The bound, `BOUND`, which `docs/cli.md` states word for word: what a file in the tree, and the
environment, can do to the report is conceded, never checked. So the tree's state is information
for a reader of the receipt and never an input to the verdict: everything it reads, the agent that
typed the command can write.

**Every control here, with what it catches and its anchor.** Each guards against a mistake that
reads as a green run, never against an agent forging the report, which the bound concedes.

- `ASSIGNED_FORGING`: a variable under which the runner reports tests that checked nothing as
  passed, set to a value that does so (`PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1`, never `=0`), assigned in the command
  itself, before a launcher or after it, after `env`. The anchor is the command's own words, which
  stayfixed reads before anything runs; the control is a closed list the adapter names
  (`forging`), and refuses nothing outside it. The same variable inherited with such a value is
  removed from the run's environment, which the receipt names (`scrubbed`). A variable an env file
  sets (`uv run --env-file`, an inherited `UV_ENV_FILE`) is past this reading: the file is the
  agent's to write, so that is the bound's.
- The report is read where the adapter put it, in the scratch directory, and where it is the
  runner's standard output, off the pipe: a file the repository committed, or text a test printed
  outside the format's own framing, is never counted. The anchor, the scratch directory and the
  pipe, is stayfixed's own; a test that writes the format's framing itself is the bound's.
- The process group: a child the command left in the background goes on writing into the tree
  after the verdict. The group is stayfixed's own anchor and is ended however the run finishes
  (`stayfixed.processes`); a descendant that leaves it is not reached, and the tee lets go of the
  pipe such a descendant holds once it has copied what is there.
- The runner's standard input: the agent, or anything upstream of `prove`, feeding it what drives
  the runner, such as the commands of pytest's debugger. The anchor is the launch stayfixed makes,
  which no one else writes: the run's standard input is `/dev/null`. It refuses no one; a test that
  reads standard input sees its end.
- `PROVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: a suite that hangs. A named cap with its flag, `not proven` past it.
- `--junit PATH` (`prove(junit=…)`), for a runner no adapter knows: no adapter is consulted, the
  command runs as typed, and the report is the file at `PATH`, read from the directory the command
  runs in. `JUNIT_UNCHANGED`: a stale or committed report the run never wrote; the anchor is the
  state of the file the path reaches, followed through a link, as the run found it before it
  started (absent, or its inode, size and modification time), so a `latest.xml` link the run
  points at the report it just wrote is counted, and a link it newly makes to a stale file is
  the bound's. The agent can write that file too, so it is a convenience and never a guarantee;
  its detail names the file by its realpath. The receipt marks the runner not verified, and the
  verdict is the cascade's as for any other run.
