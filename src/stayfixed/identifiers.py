"""One definition of what a ledger identifier looks like, from `[ledger] id_prefix`.

A prefix is the kind of string that gets respelled at each point of use — a regular expression
in one reader, a format string in a writer, a filename glob in a third — until a dozen copies
disagree about what an identifier is and no one of them can be corrected alone. One object that
every reader and writer asks is what makes a prefix that changes change all of them together,
and it is why this grammar exists at all rather than as a constant per module. A leaf module:
the ledger builds each register's identifiers from it, and the plan lint (`Fixes BR-nnn`) and the
memory graph (`[[BR-nnn]]`) read the bug ledger's through its register, from
`stayfixed.ledger.api`. The prefix is repository-controlled (principle 5): it is interpolated
into patterns and filenames, so it is held to a shape before either happens.
