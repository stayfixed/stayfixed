# Releasing stayfixed

Version discipline itself is enforced — `scripts/release.py check` cross-checks seven sources, a
tag and the record of the shipped files, and runs in CI. What was undocumented is everything
around it: how to cut a release at all. This file is that, so the bus factor of the release
process is not one.

The sequence, once, before the detail: `scripts/release.py check` → towncrier assembles
`CHANGELOG.md` from the `changelog.d/` fragments → the release commit, into whose marketplace
entry `scripts/release.py pin` writes the plugin commit it releases → `claude plugin tag` and the
`vX.Y.Z` tag, pushed without `main` → the release workflow's `build` job checks the tag, the pin
included, tests and builds, and the same workflow's `attest` job computes the plugin commit again
and attests the packages and the plugin tree's manifest → `scripts/publish_plugin.py` pushes that
pinned commit to `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin`, the repository the plugin is installed from, from
your own authenticated checkout → the `pypi` approval, whose two jobs first check that the plugin
repository's tag names the pinned commit and then release the PyPI upload and the GitHub Release,
attached to `vX.Y.Z` only and never to the floating `v1`, which immutable releases would freeze →
`main` moves to the release commit → `stayfixed overlay publish-template`, which renders
`templates/overlay/` and pushes it to the template repository from your own authenticated
checkout → from `1.0.0` on, the `v1` alias moves → the cross-repository smoke runs at the new tag →
the release returns to `dev` (section 5). Both pushes to a second repository are yours, so the
public repository's CI holds no credential that can write one.

## 1. The sources

`uv run python scripts/release.py check` refuses unless these agree:

| Source | Where the version lives |
|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | `project.version` |
| `uv.lock` | the `stayfixed` package entry — stale unless `uv sync` has run |
| `src/stayfixed/__init__.py` | `__version__` |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` |
| `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | the first `## <version>` heading after the towncrier marker |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | the plugin entry's `ref`, `vX.Y.Z`: the tag of `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin` the marketplace fetches the plugin at; its `sha` beside it is the commit that tag names, and no version |
| `hooks/hashes.json` | **not a version.** The record of the three files the harness runs — `hooks/run-hook.sh`, `hooks/hooks.json` and `scripts/stayfixed`. `scripts/release.py check` fails while it is stale and `scripts/release.py hashes` refreshes it, in whichever commit changed one of them. Nothing touches it at release time. |

The marketplace entry is held to one shape besides its `ref`: exactly one entry named
`stayfixed`, a `url` source naming `https://github.com/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git`, pinned by
`ref` and by `sha`, and no `version` of its own. The `ref` names the plugin repository's tag; the
`sha` names the commit that tag holds, so a tag moved there does not change what installs. That
commit is the plugin commit, and the release commit can name it before the plugin repository
holds it, because it is computed from the release commit alone: the plugin tree, a fixed author,
committer and date, a message naming the version, and as its parent the `sha` the release
commit's first parent pins — the plugin commit pushed last, the previous release's or a stopped
release's (section 5), which is what the plugin repository's `main` must hold — or none for
`0.3.0`, the first release the plugin repository holds. `scripts/release.py pin` writes it
(section 2, step 5). Plain `check` holds only the `sha`'s shape, 40 lowercase hex characters,
because between releases the entry pins the plugin commit pushed last, which no later tree makes.

`scripts/release.py check --tag vX.Y.Z` adds the tag as a further source, tightens one rule and
adds two: a fragment still pending in `changelog.d/` is a finding rather than a licence for
`CHANGELOG.md` to lag, a plugin tree holding more than 512 files is refused (section 2 says where
that tree comes from), and so is a marketplace entry whose `sha` is not the plugin commit, which it
computes again from `HEAD`, the commit the tag names where step 6 and `release.yml` run it. That is
the form `release.yml` runs. Section 6 is the scripts' own reference.

## 2. Cutting a release

**If this is the first release, do section 3 first.** The `pypi` environment is the only human
gate this process has, and it is a gate only once it exists: GitHub **auto-creates** an
environment that a job names and the repository does not have, with no protection rules on it.
So a first release run top to bottom without section 3 waits for nobody — `publish` runs
unapproved and fails on Trusted Publishing for want of a pending publisher, and
`github-release` runs unapproved and creates a public GitHub Release. Section 3 is what makes
step 7's sentence true.

**If this is the first release published from the plugin repository, do section 3's "The plugin
repository" first.** That is `0.3.0`, not only the first release ever: until
`stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin` exists with its three rulesets, step 1's read-back of them answers
`404` and step 7's push has nowhere to go.

**The plugin is published from a repository of its own.** The marketplace entry here fetches it
from `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin`, a `url` source pinned to the release's tag by `ref` and to the
plugin commit by `sha` (section 1), and that repository's root is the tree `scripts/plugin_tree.py`
generates from a commit of this one: the nine paths the plugin's runtime reads — the two plugin
manifests, `hooks/`, `scripts/stayfixed`, `src/stayfixed/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `README.md` and
`LICENSE` — and nothing else. Its only tags are the `vX.Y.Z` step 7 pushes there; it carries no
`stayfixed--vX.Y.Z`, which nothing there reads. Its `main` is the plugin commit pushed last, a
spent release's when that release stopped after its push, and moves only by fast-forward, each
release's commit the child of the one before, so a release commit cut on the wrong base is
refused (section 5). The Claude plugin directory holds a plugin of more than 512 files for a
reviewer ("Keep the plugin to 512 files or fewer", in its
[pre-submission checklist](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/pre-submission-checklist)), and the
count is the generated tree's: `tests/test_payload.py` holds it on every pull request, and
`scripts/release.py check --tag` again on the commit a release is cut from, before `release.yml`
builds. Not a subfolder of this repository: the same page holds every version of a plugin in a
subfolder whose hook runs a non-shell file or a shell script that calls other files, and
`hooks/run-hook.sh` runs the Python launcher. A file the runtime needs outside those nine paths
is added to `PLUGIN_PATHS` in `scripts/plugin_tree.py`, or the plugin repository never holds it.

1. **Be on `main`, current, and green.** The release workflow builds from the tag, so anything
   not merged is not in the release. `main` is current once `dev` is merged into it; section 5
   says which commit a release is cut on, after a stopped release too.

   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull
   uv run pytest -n auto --cov --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=92
   uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy
   uv run python scripts/mutation_oracle.py
   uv run python scripts/release.py check
   plugin="$(mktemp -d)"
   uv run python scripts/plugin_tree.py render --root . --rev HEAD \
     --out "$plugin/tree" --manifest-file "$plugin/plugin-tree.txt"
   claude plugin validate --strict "$plugin/tree/.claude-plugin/plugin.json"
   claude plugin validate "$plugin/tree/.codex-plugin/plugin.json"
   claude plugin validate --strict .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
   claude plugin tag --dry-run .
   ```

   The two plugin manifests are validated where the render writes them, as `ci.yml` validates
   them: the plugin repository's root is that tree, rendered from the commit, not this checkout.
   The marketplace stays here and is validated where it is.

   **And read back the four settings a tag relies on, and where the plugin repository's `main`
   is**, because none of them lives in the tree and a repository transfer carries each one over
   as it was rather than as section 3 says it should be:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/rulesets \
     --jq '.[] | select(.name == "release tags") | .id' |
     xargs -I{} gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/rulesets/{} \
     --jq '[.target, .enforcement, (.conditions.ref_name.include | sort),
            ([.rules[].type] | sort), (.bypass_actors | length)]'
   # ["tag","active",["refs/tags/stayfixed--v*","refs/tags/v*.*.*"],["deletion","update"],0]
   gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin/rulesets --jq '.[].id' |
     xargs -I{} gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin/rulesets/{} \
     --jq '[.name, .target, .enforcement, (.conditions.ref_name.include | sort),
            ([.rules[].type] | sort), (.bypass_actors | length)]'
   # ["release tags","tag","active",["refs/tags/v*.*.*"],["deletion","update"],0]
   # ["no tag-shaped branches","branch","active",["refs/heads/v*"],["creation"],0]
   # ["main","branch","active",["refs/heads/main"],["deletion","non_fast_forward"],0]
   git ls-remote https://github.com/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git refs/heads/main
   grep '"sha"' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
   # one commit on both lines, the plugin repository's main; before 0.3.0, neither prints
   gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/private-vulnerability-reporting --jq .enabled
   # true
   curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://pypi.org/pypi/stayfixed/json
   # 404 before the first release; from then on 200, with you listed as owner at
   # https://pypi.org/project/stayfixed/
   ```

   Any other answer stops the release here. A `404` from `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin` means
   section 3's "The plugin repository" has not been done: do it, then read back again. A
   ruleset that lists other patterns leaves the tag step 6 pushes movable; a plugin repository
   whose tags can move, or where a branch can take a tag's name, lets the marketplace's `ref`
   name a tree nobody attested, one whose `main` can be deleted or rewound loses the parent the
   next plugin commit names, and a fourth ruleset there is a line this listing does not expect;
   a plugin repository whose `main` is not the commit this `main`'s marketplace pins is one the
   next release cannot follow (section 5); reporting that is off sends every reporter
   `SECURITY.md` directs to the advisory form back to a public issue; and a PyPI project
   somebody else owns is one step 5's README would tell every reader to install.

2. **Decide the version.** This is a judgement, not a command. The first release is `0.1.0`,
   an alpha, and the tree already says so, with "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha". Every
   mechanism in this file works with whatever number you pick — the gate compares the tag to
   the sources rather than to a number it knows — except the alias, which is the major and
   exists from `1.0.0` on (step 9).

3. **Set it in the five places you edit by hand**, then let the lockfile follow:
   `pyproject.toml`, `src/stayfixed/__init__.py`, both plugin manifests, and the `ref` of the
   plugin entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `vX.Y.Z`.

   ```bash
   uv sync
   uv run python scripts/release.py check   # names every source that still disagrees
   ```

   That is five of the seven sources; `uv.lock` is the sixth and `uv sync` above writes it.
   `CHANGELOG.md` is the seventh and is still behind here; a pending fragment is what lets it
   lag, and step 4 catches it up.

   **And the release smoke's tag, which a test holds.** `.github/workflows/smoke-release.yml`
   calls `check.yml@vX.Y.Z`, written out, because `uses:` takes no expression; set it to the
   new version here, and in `mutations/`'s "the release smoke calls the alias a 0.x release does
   not have", whose `before` is that line.
   `tests/test_fixtures.py` fails until it names the version the tree carries, and the release
   workflow runs the suite on the tag.

   **And the two example configurations, which a test holds.** `README.md`'s and `docs/cli.md`'s
   example `stayfixed.toml` blocks each carry `version = "X.Y.Z"`, and a copy of a stale one
   makes `stayfixed doctor` warn on a brand-new project. `scripts/release.py check` cannot see
   them, because they are examples and not sources, so `tests/test_documents.py` holds them
   instead: it fails until both name the version the tree carries, and the release workflow runs
   the suite on the tag.

4. **Assemble the changelog.** A fragment that names the release's own tag cannot know it and
   spells it `vX.Y.Z`; towncrier copies a fragment's text as it is, so replace each one with the
   tag before `notes` runs (`grep -rn 'vX\.Y\.Z' changelog.d/` finds them).

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/release.py notes --version X.Y.Z --draft   # read it first; writes nothing
   uv run python scripts/release.py notes --version X.Y.Z
   uv run python scripts/release.py check   # must print "one version everywhere: X.Y.Z"
   ```

   Read what it wrote, and **edit it**. A fragment written as a note to the author rather than
   as a release note is worth fixing now — this is the text users see. The version comes before
   the changelog because `scripts/release.py notes` refuses a `--version` that is not the
   project's; after this step `CHANGELOG.md` carries the heading and `changelog.d/` is empty.
   Four things to look for, in this order:

   - **A fix for something that never shipped.** A `Fixed` entry is a fix *relative to the
     previous release*, so it is honest only if a user of that release could have met the bug,
     and a `Changed` entry only if it changes something that release did. Fragments are the
     per-commit record, so over a development cycle they accumulate fixes to code the same
     cycle introduced; a fold done earlier is undone by the next commit, which is why the check
     belongs here, once, over the assembled file. For each entry, ask whether the code it
     describes was there at the previous tag: `git log --oneline vPREV..HEAD -- <the file it
     touches>` shows whether it arrived after the tag, and `git show vPREV:<path>` shows what
     the released code did, so you can look for the described bug in it. If the bug or the
     behaviour is not there, state the feature as what it now is and delete the fix; keep the
     ones a reader of the previous release has to act on — a grammar that refuses a
     `stayfixed.toml` which loaded before, a flag that means something narrower than it sounds.
     `scripts/release.py check --tag` cannot judge this: it counts pending fragments and never
     reads them.

     **The first release is this rule with nothing to compare against.** There is no previous
     tag, so every `Fixed` entry in 0.1.0 described a bug no user could have met, and read as a
     warning about the release it shipped in. Fold them all into the features they repair
     (`init`, `attach`, `doctor` and `overlay` each accumulated several), and do the same to a
     `Changed` entry that changed something never released.

   - **Lead with what the user sees.** Open each entry with the outcome, then say why or how.
     An entry that opens with the mechanism can be read as meaning the opposite of what it goes
     on to say. When an entry enumerates cases, such as five different refusals, make it a list,
     so a reader can find the one that is theirs.

   - **No internal terms without a user-facing meaning.** A reader of the changelog has not read
     the code. 0.2.0's entries name "the note reader", "a real `stayfixed.toml`" (a file that is
     not a symlink), "the session-start line" and "the `preset-rules` and `standing-rules`
     bundle" (the first since removed) without saying what each is to someone using the tool;
     say what the user would see, or say the thing in the words the commands print.

   - **Contract changes are not fixes.** For a 0.x minor, which may break what the one before
     it did, call out what a script or a habit can depend on, because a `Fixed` entry hides
     it: an `upgrading` fragment holds it as a list, one bullet per thing a caller relies on,
     each pointing at its full entry, and the notes render it first, as **Upgrading**. Two of
     0.2.0's sat under `Fixed` and are what that hides: `stayfixed attach --check` exiting `2`
     instead of `0` for a repository whose `memory.mode` is not `overlay` (`docs/cli.md`
     documents the exit codes as the way a caller tells a finding from a refusal, so a CI
     script that ran it goes red), and `attach` newly writing a marked block into
     `.git/info/exclude`, a file it did not touch before. The third, `reply_language` and
     `artifact_language`, which `setup` still records and nothing reads, is the one 0.2.0 did
     call out, under `Changed`.

5. **Edit the README's install section, then commit.** `README.md`'s Install section names the
   release twice, in **Released as X.Y.Z.** and in the tagged `/plugin marketplace add
   stayfixed/stayfixed@vX.Y.Z`; set both to the new version. `tests/test_documents.py` fails
   until they name the version the tree carries, and the release workflow runs the suite on the
   tag. Do it now: the commit below is the release commit, and after step 6 the tag points at
   whatever this commit contains.

   **Then pin the plugin commit into it.** `scripts/release.py pin` computes the plugin commit of
   `HEAD` (section 1) and writes it into the marketplace entry's `sha`; amending it in leaves that
   commit as `pin` computed it, because the plugin tree does not hold the marketplace and the
   amend keeps the first parent:

   ```bash
   git commit -am "chore(release): X.Y.Z"
   uv run python scripts/release.py pin
   git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json && git commit --amend --no-edit
   ```

   `pin` writes nothing unless `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin`'s `main` is the plugin commit's
   parent — absent for `0.3.0`, the previous release's plugin commit after it — because that
   `main` moves only by fast-forward. Its refusal names both commits; section 5 says what each
   means. It lists `main` with `git ls-remote` through your own git, which a `url.*.insteadOf` or
   a `GIT_CONFIG_*` variable can point elsewhere, so its check is the early catch, before any tag
   is pushed; the publisher's in step 7, which asks GitHub's API, is the one that decides.

6. **Tag, twice, and check the tag.** `claude plugin tag` is the platform's own tool: it reads
   the version from `plugin.json` and creates `stayfixed--vX.Y.Z` here. `vX.Y.Z` is the tag
   `release.yml` triggers on, the one `README.md`'s install paragraph hands a reader
   (`/plugin marketplace add` takes any git ref), and the one the marketplace entry's `ref` pins
   in the plugin repository. Both name the same commit. Nothing in the install path reads the
   `stayfixed--` tag; it is what the platform's tool makes. `check --tag` computes the plugin
   commit of the tagged commit again and refuses a marketplace entry whose `sha` is another, so
   an edit to the plugin tree after `pin` stops here, before the push.

   **No prerelease tags.** `scripts/release.py check --tag` compares the tag to
   `pyproject.toml`'s literal version string, and `uv.lock` normalises a PEP 440 prerelease
   (`0.1.0-rc1` becomes `0.1.0rc1`), so the seven-source rule cannot be satisfied by an `rc` today.
   `release.yml` triggers on finals only, deliberately.

   **Push the tags, not `main`.** A pending publisher does not reserve the PyPI name: until a
   distribution exists under it anyone may upload one, and the release commit's README already
   tells a reader to `uv tool install stayfixed`. That text has to be in the release commit,
   because the README is the package's long description and the wheel is built from the tag,
   so what waits is `main`: it moves in step 7, once `publish` has put the name in your hands,
   and not before.

   ```bash
   claude plugin tag .
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   uv run python scripts/release.py check --tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z stayfixed--vX.Y.Z
   ```

7. **Watch `build` and `attest`, publish the plugin, then approve.** Watch those two jobs, not
   the whole run: the run goes on waiting for the `pypi` approval, and the plugin goes out before
   it.

   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow release --limit 1
   gh run view <id> --json jobs \
     --jq '.jobs[] | select(.name == "build" or .name == "attest") | "\(.name) \(.conclusion)"'
   # build success, then attest success, once each has finished; no conclusion while it runs
   ```

   `build` runs the gate against the tag, the pin included, tests and builds the packages.
   `attest`, which runs no suite and installs nothing, computes the plugin commit of the tag's
   commit with `scripts/plugin_tree.py commit --require-pin`, which fails on a marketplace entry
   pinning another, and attests both the packages and the plugin tree's manifest. Once both are
   green the attestations exist, and before you approve anything, push the plugin, from this
   checkout, with `gh` 2.101.0 or later logged in to `github.com`, and an SSH key GitHub knows:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/publish_plugin.py --tag vX.Y.Z          # verify, build, read back, plan
   uv run python scripts/publish_plugin.py --tag vX.Y.Z --yes    # push main and the tag
   ```

   The script reads `gh --version` before any other `gh` call and refuses a `gh` older than
   2.101.0, the version its attestation flags were measured on, since an older one lacking a flag
   would fail the verify as a wrong attestation does: upgrade `gh` and run again. It then asks
   `gh auth status --hostname github.com --active`, and checks that GitHub's
   `stayfixed/stayfixed` names the same commit under the tag as this checkout does before it runs
   any of the tag's code; it builds the plugin commit with the tag's
   own `scripts/plugin_tree.py`, read out of the tag's objects, never this checkout's copy. The
   commit is the same on every run, so the dry run names the commit the `--yes` run pushes, and
   it is the `sha` the release commit pins.

   The plugin goes first because the release commit's marketplace names `ref: vX.Y.Z` and its
   `sha` in `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin`, a tag and a commit that exist there only once this has
   run, and the approval is what makes the PyPI page and the GitHub Release public. Until then
   nothing public points at the tag, and somebody who finds it early gets an install error, not a
   wrong plugin.

   **Its exit code says what to do next**, and a refusal is never worked around — no hand-made
   push, no other checkout, no other remote. Running the command again is safe: nothing is pushed
   before its one atomic push, and a failed atomic push moves no ref.

   - **`0`: published, or ready to be.** `would push …` from the dry run: run it again with
     `--yes`. `pushed …`, or `already published …; nothing was pushed` from a run that finds the
     plugin repository's tag naming the pinned commit, wherever its `main` has moved since:
     approve.
   - **`2`: fix it and run again; the `pypi` approval waits.** Anything that is not a fact of
     the release: a tag that is not `vX.Y.Z`, or not in this checkout; a `gh` older than
     2.101.0, or one whose version cannot be read; `gh` not logged in to `github.com`, or
     offline; a local tag that is not GitHub's (`git fetch --tags`); SSH or the network failing
     `git ls-remote`, `fetch` or `push`; a GitHub or Sigstore answer that could not be had or
     read, an attestation listing that answers with none in it among them; an attestation GitHub
     holds that `gh` cannot verify on this machine even without the release's constraints — a
     network that blocks Sigstore, a trust root `gh` cannot fetch — so fix `gh` or the network;
     `git ls-remote` disagreeing with GitHub's API, which names a redirect — a `url.*.insteadOf`
     or a `GIT_CONFIG_*` variable — or a `main` that moved while it ran; a push the remote
     refused, which moved nothing, being atomic; a pushed tag GitHub does not list yet, which a
     run once GitHub lists it reports as already published, while a run before that meets
     `git ls-remote` disagreeing with GitHub's API and exits `2` again; a pushed tag GitHub lists
     under another commit, a redirect again; and a refusal or a crash of the tag's own
     `scripts/plugin_tree.py`, because CI ran the same code on the same commit green, so a cause
     on this machine is the likely one. **One of them can
     turn into a rejection:** `GitHub holds no attestation of this manifest yet` says only that
     `attest` has not written it. Wait for `build` and `attest` to go green and run again; if it
     says the same once both are green, reject the `pypi` approval. That refusal's own words end
     on the same condition, `reject the release's approval`, in lower case; its exit code, `2`,
     is what classifies it, and this rule is what turns it into a rejection.
   - **`1`: reject the `pypi` approval.** A fact of the release that no re-run changes, said in a
     refusal that ends `Reject the release's approval`: the tag's marketplace does not pin the
     plugin commit its own tree makes; the tag's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` names another
     version; an attestation of this manifest exists that `gh` verifies on this machine as
     `stayfixed/stayfixed`'s, and it does not verify against this repository's `release.yml`,
     run for this tag at this commit, on a GitHub-hosted runner; the commit built for the tag
     reads back as another tree; GitHub's plugin repository holds another commit under the tag;
     or its `main` is not the plugin commit's parent, a release commit cut on the wrong base
     (section 5). The tags are spent while nothing else is (section 5).

   A run against another `--remote` than the default (a scratch repository, a rehearsal) is
   classified from `git ls-remote` alone, reads nothing back after its push, and its summary says
   `not confirmed through GitHub's API`. The default is
   `git@github.com:stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git`, and
   `https://github.com/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git`, spelled exactly, counts as it too.

   Then approve `pypi`. **Once section 3's `pypi` environment exists with a required reviewer**,
   `publish` and `github-release` both wait for it. An approval is given per environment, not
   per job, so one approval starts both and one rejection stops both; `github-release` does not
   depend on `publish`, so a failed upload still leaves you a Release. **An approval given early
   uploads nothing:** each of the two jobs first lists the plugin repository's tag and fails,
   before it downloads or uploads anything, unless the tag names the plugin commit `attest`
   computed; publish the plugin, then re-run the two (`gh run rerun <id> --failed`). Without
   that environment both jobs run straight through the name GitHub invents for them, and nothing
   on this tag waits for a human. Watch the rest of the run:

   ```bash
   gh run watch <id> --exit-status
   ```

   When `publish` is green and `https://pypi.org/project/stayfixed/` lists you as owner, move
   `main` to the release commit:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   If `publish` failed because the name was taken in the meantime, `github-release` has still
   published a Release whose README tells readers to install that name. Delete the Release
   (`gh release delete vX.Y.Z`), leave `main` where it is, still saying nothing is released,
   and settle the name with PyPI before anything else. The tags cannot be removed (section 5).

8. **Publish the overlay template**, from this checkout, with an authenticated `gh` and an SSH
   key GitHub knows:

   ```bash
   uv run stayfixed overlay publish-template --owner stayfixed        # read the plan
   uv run stayfixed overlay publish-template --owner stayfixed --yes  # do it
   ```

   Without `--yes` nothing outward-facing happens: it renders, asks `gh` what is there, and
   reports what it would create, mark and push.

9. **Move the alias — from `1.0.0` on; a `0.x` release moves none.** The alias is the major:
   a project that writes `@v1` takes every release the alias moves to. Under semantic
   versioning a `0.x` minor may break what the one before it did, so a `v0` alias would hand
   every project on it breaking changes unannounced, and `stayfixed doctor` knows `v1` and no
   other alias. So a `0.x` project pins the commit `stayfixed init` writes, and this step starts
   at the first `1.x` release:

   ```bash
   git tag -f v1 vX.Y.Z && git push -f origin v1
   git ls-remote origin refs/tags/v1 refs/tags/vX.Y.Z   # both lines name one commit
   ```

   The alias resolves as any tag does, which step 10 proves for the release tag itself; what
   is left to check is that it names the release, and the listing above is that check.

10. **Run the cross-repository smoke at the release tag**, at every release. It calls
    `check.yml` at `@dev` and at the `vX.Y.Z` step 3 wrote into `smoke-release.yml`, which
    resolves only now that the tag is pushed.

    ```bash
    gh workflow run smoke-release.yml
    gh run watch <id> --exit-status
    ```

## 3. One-time setup

**Trusted Publishing.** The workflow authenticates to PyPI with a short-lived OIDC token rather
than a stored secret, which requires a one-time registration on PyPI:

**PyPI → Your projects → stayfixed → Publishing → Add a new publisher (GitHub)**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owner | `stayfixed` |
| Repository | `stayfixed` |
| Workflow | `release.yml` |
| Environment | `pypi` |

For the very first release, before the project exists on PyPI, use PyPI's **pending publisher**
form instead — same fields, reached from your account's publishing settings.

**The `pypi` environment — before the first tag, not after it.** Create it in **GitHub →
Settings → Environments**, and add yourself as a required reviewer. That is the last human
gate, and both `publish` and `github-release` wait behind it: a tag pushed by mistake waits
for an approval instead of becoming a permanent PyPI release or a public GitHub Release.
PyPI does not allow re-uploading a version. **Create it first**: naming an environment that
does not exist does not fail the job — GitHub creates one on the spot, with no protection
rules — so a release cut before this step would have the gate's two `environment:` lines and
none of the gate.

This paragraph is no longer the whole of the defence. `release.yml`'s `environment-gate` job
reads the environment's protection-rule count over the API before either gated job can start,
and fails the run when it is zero: the order these two sections are written in is now checked
rather than asked for. If the workflow's own token cannot read
`GET /repos/OWNER/REPO/environments/NAME` — the endpoint is not open to every default token —
the gate refuses by default, and the way to say "it is a real gate, the read is simply closed
to me" is a repository variable, **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**,
`PYPI_ENVIRONMENT_PROTECTED = true`. It stands in for the *read* only: an environment that
reads back with zero rules fails whatever the variable says. Set it only after the environment
and its reviewer exist.

**Tag protection.** A repository ruleset over `refs/tags/v*.*.*` and `refs/tags/stayfixed--v*`
with `deletion` and `update` rules, so a semver tag is immutable while the `v1` alias, once a
`1.x` release creates it — it matches neither pattern — can still move. The same body creates
the ruleset or, when one named `release tags` already exists, replaces it in place; a second
`POST` beside an existing one would leave two rulesets and fix neither:

```bash
cat > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/release-tags.json" <<'JSON'
{"name": "release tags", "target": "tag", "enforcement": "active",
 "conditions": {"ref_name": {"include": ["refs/tags/v*.*.*", "refs/tags/stayfixed--v*"], "exclude": []}},
 "rules": [{"type": "deletion"}, {"type": "update"}]}
JSON
id=$(gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name == "release tags") | .id')
if [ -n "$id" ]; then
  gh api -X PUT "repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/rulesets/$id" --input "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/release-tags.json"
else
  gh api -X POST repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/rulesets --input "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/release-tags.json"
fi
```

**The plugin repository.** Before the first `scripts/publish_plugin.py --yes`, create
`stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin`, public and empty — no README, licence or `.gitignore`, because its
first commit is the one `publish_plugin.py` builds — and protect its tags and its `main`. A
ruleset applies every rule it carries to every ref it matches and has one target, tags or
branches, so three rulesets: `release tags`, with `deletion` and `update` rules over
`refs/tags/v*.*.*`, so a published tag never moves; `no tag-shaped branches`, with a `creation`
rule over `refs/heads/v*`, so no branch can take a tag's name and shadow it; and `main`, with
`deletion` and `non_fast_forward` rules over `refs/heads/main`, so the commit each release's
plugin commit names as its parent stays where the next one finds it. None of them refuses the
first push, which creates `main` and a tag. The same create-or-replace as above, with the
repository name changed:

```bash
gh repo create stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin --public \
  --description "The stayfixed plugin, generated from stayfixed/stayfixed at each release"
cat > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plugin-release-tags.json" <<'JSON'
{"name": "release tags", "target": "tag", "enforcement": "active",
 "conditions": {"ref_name": {"include": ["refs/tags/v*.*.*"], "exclude": []}},
 "rules": [{"type": "deletion"}, {"type": "update"}]}
JSON
cat > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plugin-tag-shaped-branches.json" <<'JSON'
{"name": "no tag-shaped branches", "target": "branch", "enforcement": "active",
 "conditions": {"ref_name": {"include": ["refs/heads/v*"], "exclude": []}},
 "rules": [{"type": "creation"}]}
JSON
cat > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plugin-main.json" <<'JSON'
{"name": "main", "target": "branch", "enforcement": "active",
 "conditions": {"ref_name": {"include": ["refs/heads/main"], "exclude": []}},
 "rules": [{"type": "deletion"}, {"type": "non_fast_forward"}]}
JSON
ruleset() {  # $1 the ruleset's name, $2 its body: replace the one of that name, or create it
  id=$(gh api repos/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin/rulesets --jq ".[] | select(.name == \"$1\") | .id")
  if [ -n "$id" ]; then
    gh api -X PUT "repos/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin/rulesets/$id" --input "$2"
  else
    gh api -X POST repos/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin/rulesets --input "$2"
  fi
}
ruleset "release tags" "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plugin-release-tags.json"
ruleset "no tag-shaped branches" "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plugin-tag-shaped-branches.json"
ruleset "main" "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/plugin-main.json"
```

Then read the three back with section 2's step 1, whose listing names each of them on a line of
its own; any other answer is a repository to fix before anything is pushed to it.

**Private vulnerability reporting.** `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and both issue-template
files send reporters to the advisory form, which exists only while the repository setting is on:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/stayfixed/stayfixed/private-vulnerability-reporting
```

**A conduct contact address.** `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` still routes a report through the security
advisory form. That is worth a real address before the repository is advertised.

## 4. The harness CLI version

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` each `npm install -g
@anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>` — the validator the first one runs and the installer the
second one runs are the same tool, and the two pins must move together. A global npm install is
not a manifest, so Dependabot does not see either of them: bump both by hand, in one commit,
and let the smoke run say whether an install still works.

**The overlay template's own action pins.** `src/stayfixed/templates/overlay/.github/workflows/scan.yml`
pins two actions by full-length sha, and this repository's `.github/dependabot.yml` scans
`.github/workflows/` at the root and nothing else — a nested tree under `src/` is not a
workflow directory the platform reads, so those two pins rot here until somebody looks.
The same file's `GITLEAKS_VERSION` and the `rev:` of the template's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
(a sha, with its release in a `# frozen:` comment) are not action pins at all, so no configured
Dependabot sees them (it has a `pre-commit` ecosystem, which neither `dependabot.yml` sets up):
bump them by hand, to one gitleaks release, in one commit.
`tests/overlay/test_template.py` holds the two equal.
A rendered overlay ships its own `dependabot.yml` and keeps itself current from then on;
what this line is about is the state every *new* overlay starts from. Check them here, at
the release that publishes the template.

**The project workflow's pin, and what the first tag unlocks.** There is a second sha-pinned
template now: `src/stayfixed/templates/project/stayfixed.yml`, the caller `stayfixed init` renders
into an adopting project's `.github/workflows/`. Its `uses:` line is not pinned in the tree —
the sha is filled in at render time, and it is the commit of the *released* stayfixed that did
the rendering, read off this repository's own `v*` tags. So nothing here rots, and nothing here
needs checking at a release; what a release changes is whether the workflow can be written at
all. Before the first tag `init` finds no released commit to name, reports the workflow skipped
with that reason, and writes nothing into `.github/` — which means every project initialised
before the first release carries no CI caller and no `[ci] ref`, and gets both when `stayfixed
upgrade` ships. The first tag is the event that changes that, and it changes it for new
projects only.

## 5. If something goes wrong

- **Anything goes wrong after the tags are pushed.** The ruleset refuses to delete or move a
  pushed `vX.Y.Z` or `stayfixed--vX.Y.Z`, for everyone, so that version is spent whether or not
  anything was published: a wrong tag, a red `build`, a rejected approval or a failed upload.
  `main` has not moved, so nothing else needs undoing. Cut X.Y.(Z+1) from step 3, the
  `CHANGELOG.md` heading included, on the commit "Which commit a release is cut on", below,
  names. If a Release was created for the spent version, delete it, as step 7 says for a taken
  name.
- **Which commit a release is cut on.** A release commit's first parent decides its plugin
  commit's parent (section 1), and the plugin repository's `main` must be that parent, so:
  - **`0.3.0`**, the first release the plugin repository holds, is cut on `main` once `dev` is
    merged into it. `main` before that merge still holds the marketplace entry `"source": "./"`,
    which `scripts/plugin_tree.py` refuses to read a pin from, since the entry's `source` is not
    an object; the merge brings `dev`'s `url` entry, which pins no `sha`, so the first plugin
    commit has no parent, as the plugin repository's absent `main` requires.
  - **Any later release** is cut on `main` once `dev` is merged into it, since `dev` carries the
    `sha` of the plugin commit pushed last ("How a release returns to `dev`", below).
  - **After a stopped release whose plugin was not pushed**, on `main`, as the stopped one was:
    the plugin repository's `main` has not moved, so fix the spent release commit in place, an
    amend keeping its first parent.
  - **After a stopped release whose plugin was pushed**, on the spent release commit, as a new
    commit on top of it: the plugin repository's `main` is now the spent release's plugin commit,
    which only that commit's marketplace pins; a merge of `dev` into it, if `dev` moved, keeps it
    the first parent. `main` here then moves over both in step 7.

  `pin` says which, before any tag is pushed: its refusal names the parent the plugin commit has
  and the commit the plugin repository's `main` holds, and `git ls-remote
  https://github.com/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git refs/tags/vX.Y.Z` lists the spent version's
  tag there when its plugin was pushed. A patch release of an older line, `0.3.1` after `0.4.0`,
  is not supported: its plugin commit's parent is not the plugin repository's `main`, so `pin`
  refuses it, and so would the publisher.
- **How a release returns to `dev`.** Once the release is out, branch `chore/after-release-X.Y.Z`
  from `main`, the release commit, and merge it into `dev` through a pull request. `dev`'s
  marketplace then pins the release's `sha`, and the next `dev` → `main` merge brings it back to
  `main`, where the next release commit's first parent pins it. A merge into `main` (or into a
  spent release commit) that resolved `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to a `dev` copy pinning
  another `sha` loses it: a copy pinning none gives the next plugin commit no parent, and `pin`
  refuses it with no parent while the plugin repository's `main` exists; a copy pinning an older
  one, as `dev` does after a stopped release whose plugin was pushed, gives it that older parent,
  and `pin` refuses it the same way, naming both. Nothing is spent yet, since `pin` runs before
  the tags: put the commit the plugin repository's `main` holds — the plugin commit pushed last,
  a spent release's if one stopped after its push — back into the entry, in a commit of its own
  beneath the release commit, and make the release commit again:

  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD^   # the local release commit, undone; its edits stay staged
  git ls-remote https://github.com/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git refs/heads/main
  # set the entry's "sha" in .claude-plugin/marketplace.json to the commit that printed, then:
  git commit -m "chore: restore the plugin pin" -- .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
  ```

  The path-limited commit takes the marketplace alone, with the `ref` step 3 set, and leaves the
  release's other edits staged; step 5 then runs again from its first command.
- **The plugin push was refused or failed.** `scripts/publish_plugin.py` pushes `main` and the
  tag together, atomically, and only after the attestation and the read-back held, so a refusal
  or a failed push leaves the plugin repository as it was, and this repository's `main` and the
  `pypi` approval where they were. Step 7 says, by its exit code, when to run it again and when
  to reject the approval. A plugin tag that was pushed is spent like this repository's: its
  ruleset refuses to move or delete it, and the next release is X.Y.(Z+1). A push that went
  through for a release that then stopped — a rejected approval, a failed upload — stays, beside
  the spent tag of this repository that names it: `main` here still installs the previous
  release, but the spent `stayfixed/stayfixed@vX.Y.Z` still installs that plugin, because its
  marketplace's `ref` and `sha` resolve. The next release is cut on the spent release commit, so
  its plugin commit follows that one.
- **PyPI published a bad release.** You cannot replace it. Yank it on PyPI (which hides it from
  resolvers without breaking anyone who has already pinned it) and release a patch version.
- **`scripts/release.py check` fails in the workflow but passed locally.** Almost always
  `uv.lock`: `uv sync` was not run after the version bump, so the lockfile still carries the old
  one. The other candidate is `hooks/hashes.json`, if a shipped file moved without
  `scripts/release.py hashes`.
- **`publish-template` pushed the wrong tree.** The next `publish-template` fixes it: it
  replaces the tree whole rather than merging into it.

## 6. The release scripts

`scripts/release.py` is this repository's own tooling, not a command stayfixed ships: it only
ever checked the stayfixed repository itself. It runs through the same frame as the CLI, so
`--json` is accepted anywhere on the line and prints one object, and it exits `0` on success,
`1` on findings and `2` on a refusal.

```bash
uv run python scripts/release.py check [--tag TAG]               # one version everywhere
uv run python scripts/release.py notes --version X.Y.Z [--draft]  # assemble CHANGELOG.md
uv run python scripts/release.py hashes [--check]                 # the record of the shipped files
uv run python scripts/release.py pin [--remote URL]               # the plugin commit, pinned
```

**`check`** cross-checks the seven sources of section 1 and exits `1` naming every one that
disagrees. Its `--json` object carries `summary`, `versions` (every source and what it says) and
`problems` (empty on a clean run), and it carries all three whether or not there is drift — the
drift is in `problems`, not in the shape. A source it cannot parse at all is still a failure and
prints `error` instead. `--tag` accepts both tag shapes, `vX.Y.Z` and `stayfixed--vX.Y.Z`,
because either may be the ref a run was created from. Under `--tag` it also runs
`scripts/plugin_tree.py commit` on `HEAD`, and refuses a plugin tree past the 512 files the plugin
directory lists unheld (section 2), a marketplace entry that pins no `sha` or another commit than
the plugin commit that tree makes (the `plugin pin` finding, which names the commit and, for an
entry pinning none, says to run `pin`), and a tree that script could not read, quoting what it
said — a clone without `HEAD`'s first parent among them, which it names `fetch-depth: 2` for.
Plain `check`, which CI runs on every pull request, never counts and never computes the commit,
because `tests/test_payload.py` holds the same count there and the pin is the release commit's
alone. It writes nothing; it reads the sources, the fragments pending in `changelog.d/`,
`hooks/hashes.json` beside the three files it records, and under `--tag` the committed tree.

**`notes`** is a wrapper around towncrier, which does the rendering while `[tool.towncrier]` in
`pyproject.toml` owns the format. A `--version` that is not the project's is refused (`2`) before
towncrier runs, because assembling under another number writes a `CHANGELOG.md` heading that
`check` then refuses; a towncrier that cannot be run is a finding (`1`) naming it as the
development dependency it is. Without `--draft` it writes `CHANGELOG.md` and consumes the
fragments: towncrier removes each one from `changelog.d/` and, in a git checkout, stages both
changes — `git add` of `CHANGELOG.md`, `git rm` of each tracked fragment, which removes the
directory itself when the tracked fragments were all it held. With `--draft` it writes nothing
and prints the rendered section.

**`hashes`** records the sha256 of the three files the harness executes without Python —
`hooks/run-hook.sh`, `hooks/hooks.json` and `scripts/stayfixed` — into `hooks/hashes.json` beside
them; a wheel's own contents are the packaging tool's to attest. The record is refused rather
than written when any of the three is missing: a record naming two of three would still claim to
be what the release shipped, while naming less, and every later comparison would report drift
against that claim. It is not a release-time command: `check` compares the record to the
tree on every run, so editing any of the three without re-recording fails the gate in the same
commit, which is what makes it a record somebody has watched fail. `stayfixed doctor`'s `files`
row reads the installed record against the installed files. Under `--check` it writes nothing,
exits `1` on drift, and its `--json` object carries `summary`, `files` and `problems` in both
outcomes.

**`pin`** is step 5's command: it computes the plugin commit of `HEAD` with
`scripts/plugin_tree.py commit` and writes it into the marketplace entry's `sha`, once it has
listed the plugin repository's `main` (`--remote`, by default
`https://github.com/stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin.git`, only ever listed) and found it the commit's
parent. Everything it refuses, it refuses before writing: a tree that script cannot make the
commit of, a marketplace on disk that cannot take the `sha`, a remote that cannot be listed, and a
`main` that is not the parent (section 5). Two runs write the same file.

**`scripts/plugin_tree.py`** names the plugin's nine paths once, in `PLUGIN_PATHS`, reads them
from a commit and never from the disk, and writes the manifest a release attests and the plugin
commit a release pins, `--no-parent` only ever for a scratch repository; its module docstring
and `--help` are its reference.

```bash
uv run python scripts/plugin_tree.py manifest --root . --rev HEAD [--exact] [--manifest-file FILE]
uv run python scripts/plugin_tree.py render --root . --rev HEAD --out DIR [--manifest-file FILE]
uv run python scripts/plugin_tree.py commit --root . --rev HEAD --git-dir DIR \
  [--manifest-file FILE] [--no-parent] [--require-pin]
```

**`scripts/publish_plugin.py`** is step 7's command, which builds the plugin commit a tag pins
with that tag's own code, verifies its attestation, and pushes it to the plugin repository as
`main` and the tag, atomically, only under `--yes`; its module docstring and `--help` are its
reference, and step 7 its exit codes.

```bash
uv run python scripts/publish_plugin.py --tag vX.Y.Z [--remote URL] [--yes]
```
