"""Push the plugin commit a release pinned to the plugin's own repository, and nothing else.

    uv run python scripts/publish_plugin.py --tag vX.Y.Z [--remote URL] [--yes]

The plugin is published from `stayfixed/stayfixed-plugin`, a repository whose root is the plugin's
tree at a commit of this one. Its commit is a function of the release commit: the tree, a fixed
author, committer and date, a message naming the version, and as its parent the commit the
marketplace pinned at the release commit's first parent. So the release commit pins it
(`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`'s `sha`), and this, the owner's one command after the release's
tags, builds that commit again and pushes it as `main` and as the tag, atomically. Without `--yes`
it does everything but the push and says which commit it would push; the commit is the same from
run to run, so a dry run names the commit a later run pushes.

**The tag's own code builds the commit.** `scripts/plugin_tree.py` and `src/stayfixed` are read out
of the tag's objects — `ls-tree` and `cat-file`, regular files only, never `git archive`, which
applies the owner's attributes and line endings — written into the scratch directory, and run as
`python -I`, the tag's `src` first on `sys.path`: the checkout's copy of either may be another
release's. Before any of it runs, the local tag's commit is compared with the one GitHub's
`stayfixed/stayfixed` holds under that tag, so the code run is the release's own, and the
attestation binds the same commit afterwards.

**What it trusts, and why.** Every answer it trusts is GitHub's, asked of `github.com` by name, so
`gh auth status --hostname github.com --active` must pass before the first is asked, and before it
`gh --version` must be a release at least 2.101.0, the gh every flag below and its exact identity
match were measured on, so an older gh is told so rather than left to fail the verify. The
attestation says which manifest a release vouches for: `gh attestation verify` binds the manifest's
bytes to the certificate identity of this repository's `release.yml` run for this tag
(`--cert-identity`, matched exactly, where `--signer-workflow` matched a prefix), for this tag's
ref (`--source-ref`) at this commit (`--source-digest`), on a GitHub-hosted runner
(`--deny-self-hosted-runners`). A verify that fails is a fact of this machine as much as of the
release, and the publisher never asks for a rejection on it alone: it refuses, and GitHub's listing
of attestations of the manifest's digest only chooses the advice — none yet, run again once the
release's `build` and `attest` jobs are green; one that does not verify here, run again with a
working gh and network; the same answer then is the owner's to reject. The commit is read back whole
and its manifest compared with that one byte for byte before anything leaves the machine. The plugin
repository's state is GitHub's: on the default remote, `main` and the tag are read through `gh api`
as well as `ls-remote`, and a disagreement is a redirect (a `url.*.insteadOf`, a `GIT_CONFIG_*`
variable) refused rather than classified, and after a push the tag is read back through the API,
which must name the commit pushed; another `--remote` (a test, a rehearsal) is read from
`ls-remote` alone, and the summary says so. CI holds no credential to the plugin repository: the
owner's own git pushes, with the owner's own key.

**Commit ids are compared, never manifests.** A remote whose tag already names the pinned commit is
"already published": exit `0`, nothing fetched or pushed, wherever its `main` has moved since. A
tag naming another commit is a fact of the release no re-run changes. Without the tag, `main` must
be the commit's parent — both absent for the first release — because `main` moves only by
fast-forward: a release cut on the wrong base, or a patch release of an older line, is refused.

**Two exit codes after `0`.** `1` rejects the release's approval: the tag's pin is not the commit
its tree makes; its `plugin.json` names another version; the commit reads back as another tree;
GitHub's plugin repository holds another commit under the tag, or a `main` that is not the commit's
parent. `2` says fix something and run again: anything else — a gh too old or not logged in, a
failed attestation verify whatever GitHub lists, a pushed tag GitHub does not list or lists
elsewhere, the tag's own code refusing, since CI ran the same code on the same commit.

The command goes through the CLI frame's `run`, as `scripts/release.py`'s do: `--json` anywhere on
the line, and `Rejected` is the frame's `Failure`, exit `1`.
