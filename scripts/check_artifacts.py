"""Check the built artifacts carry what an installed stayfixed needs.

    uv run python scripts/check_artifacts.py dist            # the one wheel and one sdist
    uv run python scripts/check_artifacts.py rendered DIR    # what `overlay create --local` left

The checkout passes every test with the template tree in place; only an artifact can say
whether `uv_build` shipped it. Exit 0 with no findings, 1 with them.

Three things this looks at, each of which was an inline CI step or nothing at all:

* **The wheel.** CI installs from source, so a packaging regression that dropped the preset,
  the overlay template or the project footprint's templates would break every `uv tool install`
  while the workflow stayed green. `resources.files` resolves to the checkout under `uv run`,
  which is why no test in `tests/` can see this.
* **The sdist.** A packager for Homebrew, Debian or nixpkgs cannot run a single test against
  an sdist that ships only `src/`, which is the artefact they most need to verify for a
  security-sensitive tool. `skills/` and `agents/` are here because
  `tests/skills/test_skills.py` reads those trees directly. And `tar` preserves the mode: a
  wrapper unpacked at 0644 exits 126 for every hook entry, which Claude Code reads as a
  permission error rather than as a broken install.
* **A rendered overlay.** `overlay create --local` is the one working source for a first
  overlay, and what it leaves behind has to be the files the package ships plus the scaffold
  ledger — no more and no less — inside a git repository, which `--local` initialises.
