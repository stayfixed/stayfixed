"""The clone-to-exfiltration scenario: a hostile clone, run end to end against a plugin root.

    python3 scripts/smoke_exfiltration.py --plugin-root R --fixture F --scratch S

The clone commits a note claiming to be a standing rule, names ANOTHER project, and ships a
`.claude/settings.json` `env` block pointing stayfixed at a machine configuration inside itself.
This script materialises that `env` block the way a harness would — the relative value becomes
an absolute path inside the scratch clone — and then asks each boundary the scenario is about,
one printed row each.

**Every negative row has its positive control.** "The canary is absent" is also what a broken
pipeline prints, so the first row shows the clone's volatile note reaching a session, as data,
beside the standing rule it claims never reaching one. A row that could only ever have been green
is not evidence.

The scenario's MCP arm — `memory_search` under an explicit `project=` — is not run: stayfixed
ships no MCP server yet (the README lists the memory MCP server under "Not yet"), and the run
says so in its own output rather than leaving a silent gap in the scenario.
