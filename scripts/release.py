"""This repository's own release discipline: one version everywhere, the changelog, the record.

    uv run python scripts/release.py check [--tag TAG]            # one version everywhere
    uv run python scripts/release.py notes --version X.Y.Z [--draft]  # assemble CHANGELOG.md
    uv run python scripts/release.py hashes [--check]              # the shipped files' record
    uv run python scripts/release.py pin [--remote URL]            # the plugin commit, pinned

These commands only ever checked or wrote the stayfixed repository itself, so they live beside it
rather than in the installed CLI. What shipped code does read stays in `stayfixed.release`: the
record's reader (`doctor files` compares an installed plugin against it) and the tag a version
is released under (`init` pins it). `RELEASING.md` is the process these commands serve.

The commands go through the CLI frame's `run`, so they keep its contract: `--json` anywhere on
the line, exit `0`, `1` for findings and `2` for a refusal or an internal error.

**`check --tag` holds the release commit to what it releases:** the seven version sources and the
tag agree, no fragment is left to assemble, the plugin tree holds no more files than the plugin
directory lists unheld, and the marketplace entry's `sha` is the plugin commit that tree makes,
which `scripts/plugin_tree.py commit` computes from the commit alone. `pin` writes that `sha`, once
it has read that the plugin repository's `main` is the commit's parent: `main` moves only by
fast-forward, so a release commit cut on the wrong base is refused before any tag is pushed.

**Findings are returned, not raised.** These commands once reported a finding by raising
`Failure`, and the cost was in `--json`: the frame turns a `Failure` into
`{"error": "failed", "summary": "failed: ..."}` and drops `Result.data` entirely, so the
machine-readable object changed *shape* between a clean run and a drifted one -- a consumer that
read `versions` on success had nothing to read on the run it actually cared about. `Failure` is
still raised for what it is for: a source this gate cannot parse at all (`MalformedSource`) and
a towncrier that cannot be run.

**`notes --draft` prints more than one line**, and it is deliberate: every stayfixed command
gets one summary line because a line is what a caller reads, and a draft's whole purpose is that
a person reads the section towncrier *would* write before it is written. Under `--json` it keeps
the one-line contract.
