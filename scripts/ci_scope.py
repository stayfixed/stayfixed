"""Whether a pull request reaches code: what the `changes` job of `ci.yml` and `smoke.yml` writes.

    python3 -I scripts/ci_scope.py BASE HEAD

Prints `false` when every path that differs between the two commits is a document or a Python file
whose change is to comments alone, and `true` otherwise, an empty change included. `false` narrows
the run to one leg of the suite, which still runs ruff, mypy and coverage, so `# noqa`,
`# type: ignore` and `# pragma: no cover` are still judged there; the other legs, the oracle, the
real runners and the plugin checks are skipped. Anything this script cannot read, or a failure of
its own, counts as code: the step it runs in fails under `bash -e`, writes no answer, and every job
reading it runs whole.

A document is a path under `docs/` or `changelog.d/`, or a Markdown file at the repository's root.
Markdown under `skills/` or `agents/` is not one: the plugin validator reads it. A Python change is
to comments alone when both sides tokenize to the same tokens once comments and blank lines are
dropped: a docstring is a string and counts as code, and a file added, deleted or that does not
tokenize counts as code.

Not a control: the script and the workflow that runs it come from the pull request, which can
rewrite either. It spares an honest change the full matrix; a reviewer reads the diff.
