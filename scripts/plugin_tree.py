This repository is more than the plugin: its tests, documents, plans and tooling ship nowhere. The
plugin is published from a repository of its own whose root is the tree this script generates, and
`PLUGIN_PATHS` is the one place its paths are named: the release check, the payload test and the
workflows that build, install and attest the plugin all run this script, or, in a test, import it.

**Read from a commit, never from the disk.** The directory, the attestation and the plugin
repository each see a commit, so a file edited, deleted or only staged here is not in what they
see, and must not be in what this script reports either. Every byte comes from `git ls-tree` and
`git cat-file` at one commit, resolved once; no filter, attribute or line-ending conversion of a
working tree touches it.

**The manifest is the text a release attests.** One line naming its format, then one line per
file: its git mode, the sha256 of its bytes and its path. `publish_plugin.py` compares two of them
and nothing else, which is why a path holding a control character, or one that is not UTF-8, is
refused rather than written: a `\\n` in a name would forge a line, and a C1 control or a Unicode
line separator breaks the line a terminal or an editor shows.

**The plugin repository's commit is computed here,** as a function of the source commit alone: the
tree's objects, and a commit of them with a fixed author, committer and date, a message naming the
version, and as its parent the commit the marketplace pinned at the source commit's first parent.
So the release commit can name, in its marketplace entry, the commit the plugin repository will
hold, and anyone holding the source commit and its first parent can compute that commit again and
compare.

The commands go through the CLI frame's `run`, as `scripts/release.py`'s do: `--json` anywhere on
the line, exit `0`, `1` when `commit --require-pin` finds the source commit pinning another
commit, and `2` for a refusal.
