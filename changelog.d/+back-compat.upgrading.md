stayfixed no longer carries code for what 0.3.x and earlier releases left on a machine or in an
overlay. A `trust.json` still holding the flat map 0.3.x wrote, a store's path to its digest, is
now refused as unreadable instead of read as holding no approval, and nothing overwrites it: delete
it, since the store approvals it holds are ones nothing asks about. `stayfixed doctor` reports
fifteen rows. The `files` row is gone: `wrapper` now reports a hook wrapper that is not executable
under a plugin root the environment names, where it runs nothing. The `retired-deny` row is gone
too, and so is the `recommended` preset's `[deny] retired` key, so `stayfixed setup` no longer
takes `Read(.env*)` or `Read(**/.env*)` out of `~/.claude/settings.json`; if either is still
there, delete it by hand, since it refuses `.env.example` too. `stayfixed overlay upgrade` no
longer removes the four files earlier releases shipped in an overlay and this one does not:
`common/memory/README.md`, `skills/attach/SKILL.md`, `common/rules/README.md` and
`hooks/hooks.json`. If any of them is still in your overlay, delete it by hand, the memory README
first, since the note reader reads it as a note.
