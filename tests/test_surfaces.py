"""The three checks every `api.py` is held to, asked once of every package that publishes one:
each area with a surface, and the `release` package, which is not an area and is held to its
surface like one.

CONTRIBUTING states the contract once for all of them: "`api.py` is the area's import surface.
Other areas import from it and from nothing else, and its `__all__` must equal exactly what it
imports — a test parses the file and checks." Nine modules each carried a copy of that parse,
eight of them byte-identical; six carried a copy of the derived signature check and four did
not; and `stayfixed.hooks.api` had no surface test at all, because a contract enforced by ten
hand-written copies is enforced only where somebody remembered to write the eleventh.

What stays in `tests/<area>/test_surface.py` is the one thing that is genuinely the area's own:
the list of names it publishes, with the argument for each beside it. That list is a decision
per area. These three checks are not.

`stayfixed.scaffold` is not here. It publishes from the package rather than from an `api.py` —
the scaffold engine's contract, frozen — and `tests/scaffold/test_surface.py` holds it to its
own shape.
