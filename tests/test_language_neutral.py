"""The core names no language stack: what one stack's runner, artifacts or package manager need
lives in that stack's profile directory, `src/stayfixed/profiles/<name>/`, so a repository in
several languages works with no configuration.

The walk reads every module under `src/stayfixed/` outside those stack directories with `ast` --
the profiles' own machinery directly under `profiles/` is core and is read -- so comments and
docstrings are prose and are never read; string and bytes constants (an f-string's literal parts
included) and identifiers are code and are. A word counts where it stands alone, letters and
digits on neither side, so `PYTEST`, `is_pytest_run` and `"*.pyc"` are mentions and
`pipeline` is not.

`STACK_NAMED` is every mention the walk finds, each with the reason it stays in the core, and the
comparison is equality both ways: a new mention reddens this test, and so does a pardon whose
mention is gone, so the list never outlives what it excuses.

The words catch a stack named in the core; they do not catch the core importing a stack's own
code, because `stayfixed.profiles.python.hygiene` holds no listed word. So the same walk also reads
every import, and a core module that imports from a shipped profile's directory fails on its own.
