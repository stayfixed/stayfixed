# Two tests here used to assert on *prose*: `"trust.wrap" in refusal_reason.__doc__`, and the
# same two substrings in `inspect.getsource(Store)`. They were green the whole time the
# behaviour they are nominally about was broken — `memory.commands._store` put the very string
# that docstring warns about straight into a `Failure` message, which `cli._report` prints on
# stdout under `--json`. A documentation lint passing next to a live instance of the defect it
# describes is worse than no test, because it reads like coverage.
#
# The behaviour is pinned where it happens, in
# `tests/memory/test_commands.py::test_a_refusal_reason_reaching_stdout_is_wrapped_as_data` and
# its forged-marker sibling. What stays here is the one thing those cannot say: that the value
# really is repository-authored, which is why the wrapping is needed at all.
