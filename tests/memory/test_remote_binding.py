"""Which `origin` is the remote a binding was recorded with: one repository, whatever transport.

The remote binds nothing -- the binding is the id in the git common directory -- but a checkout
whose `origin` is not the recorded one hears a note (`origin_note`). The three spellings git and
the forges hand out for one repository -- `git@host:owner/repo`, `ssh://git@host/owner/repo` and
`https://host/owner/repo`, each with or without `.git` -- are one remote, so a clone made over https
of a repository bound over ssh hears nothing, and nothing else is normalised: a different owner,
repository, host, user or port is a different remote, and so is any URL outside those three shapes
unless it is the recorded one byte for byte.
