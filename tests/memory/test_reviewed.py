"""A note counts as the owner's only once promoted, and only at the bytes that were promoted.

The record is a `reviewed` entry in `trust.json`, beside the machine file and outside every tree,
so a note a repository ships, one the harness's writer or an agent wrote, and one the owner edited
after promoting it all arrive the same way: unreviewed, as data, and never as a standing rule.
