"""The machine owner's session budgets reach every command that measures what a session loads, as
they reach the session (`config.loader.load` folds the owner's layer that `config.session` folds).

A command and a session that read one machine file on two sets of budgets gave two answers to one
question: with `[budgets] volatile_notes_words` raised in the machine file, `memory fit` passed a
bundle the session rendered into a part no hook slot holds, while `doctor`'s `bundles` row, which
reads the session's configuration, was red; and `memory_index_words` from the machine file reached
nothing a command enforced.
