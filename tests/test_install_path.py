"""The owner's walkthrough, offline, in a temporary directory.

Every package is tested on its own against stubs. This is the one test that runs them in the
order a person does, and it exists because the four packages' seams — the machine file, the
overlay root, the project record, the composed store, the ignore region — are each written by one
package and read by another, and a stub on both sides of a seam agrees with itself.

**Every step runs the real launcher.** Each one used to call a library function, so the
argv wiring of eight commands — the flag names, the `--yes` gate reached through argparse, the
`--machine` refusal from a pipe, the JSON `doctor` prints — was exercised by nothing that ran
them in order. `_cli` below runs `scripts/stayfixed` in a subprocess, which is how a person and
how a skill reach these commands.

Nothing here touches the network, the real `~`, or any harness binary. `HOME` is a scratch
directory and every harness variable is dropped, and the binaries the CLI resolves through
`PATH` on purpose — `gh`, `claude`, `codex` and `pre-commit`, the owner's own — are answered by
a scratch `bin/` placed first on the subprocess's `PATH`. `pre-commit` there writes the commit
hook `doctor` later asks about, rather than only recording that it was called. `git` is real,
because a repository with no `origin` is not the thing being tested.

    another repository's work tree holds it, since that repository can put files into it.

# What `docs/cli.md` says `stayfixed doctor` launches on a green attached installation *besides*
# the `ci-ref` row, which the stub runner below answers in process rather than launching — so one
# more in production on a repository that records a `[ci] ref`, which is what `docs/cli.md` says.
# Written as a number rather than as a set of argv lists so the failure reads as "the count
# moved", which is the claim.
#
# Five and not four since the binding's and the note store's rows moved into their own areas:
# each area resolves the note store for its own rows, once per report, and in overlay mode a
# resolution asks `git` for the checkout's `origin`. So `attached` and the store's two rows ask
# it once each, where one shared context used to ask it once for all three.
#
# Six and not five since `hook-entries` asks git's index which files below the root a nested
# `.claude/skills` holds, in place of walking the whole tree.
#
# Seven and not six since the `attached` row asks git which checkout owns this one wherever its
# answer turns on the owning checkout's store or `paths.memory` — every shape of the harness memory
# path but a dangling link and a real directory with no fallback recorded — and not only beside a
# link: the gate it asks is the owning checkout's, which `attach` asks, so a linked worktree reads
# one machine state as the main checkout does.
#
# Eight and not seven since the binding is the id in the git common directory: each note-store
# resolution asks git for the common directory where it asked for the `origin`, and the `attached`
# row asks for both, the `origin` for the note it may print beside the state.
#
# Nine and not eight since a session's preferences resolve over the overlay's project file, read
# only for the project the binding record names: the report reads the configuration as a session
# does, so it asks git for the common directory once more, where the binding id is kept.
#
# Fourteen and not nine since the `attached` row reads the delivery — the binding id, whether a
# placed path is tracked (`git ls-files`) or ignored (`git check-ignore`), and whether a tracked
# file names the delivery (`git grep`) — and since this case runs under the walkthrough's `HOME`,
# where the binding record is. Under the suite's own `HOME` the row found no record, read the
# checkout as unbound and warned, and asked nothing a bound checkout's rows ask, so the nine it
# counted were not a green installation's.
#
# Thirteen and not fourteen since `attach` points the harness at the composed store: the row reads
# the pointer, which asks git for the common directory where the binding id is kept, and no longer
# asks which checkout owns this one to judge the harness memory path the harness does not read.
#
# Twelve and not thirteen since the harness memory path is gone and the `attached` row reads the
# pointer from the main checkout's settings file: the main checkout is named once, by the first
# record of `git worktree list`, and the pointer is compared with the composed store of the id the
# row has already read, so the common directory is not asked for it again.
#
# Fourteen and not twelve since the `memory` row names the settings file that sets the harness's
# `autoMemoryDirectory`: it asks whether this checkout is a registered worktree (its common and its
# own git directory) to read the main checkout's settings file, which a linked worktree reads too.
#
# Thirteen and not fourteen since `hook-entries` no longer walks for skills, commands and agents,
# whose walk asked git's index for the nested skills directories.
