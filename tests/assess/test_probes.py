"""The probes no gate runs: what each finds over files and the git index, and that a probe which
could not look says so instead of reporting nothing.

Every advisory case names the mutation that reddens it in its own comment; the warnings a person
would act on have entries of their own, `mutations/`'s "the tracked-env probe stops reporting a
committed .env file" -> a committed secret; and "a probe reads a git query that did not answer as
nothing found" -> a query that hid one.
