"""A `trail.toml` theme's `pattern`: a subset of regular-expression syntax, matched the way
`re.search` matches it, and never by backtracking.

The subset is pinned against `re` itself rather than against a description of it: every pattern
up to four tokens over an alphabet holding each construct the language keeps, against every name
up to four characters, gives the same answer both ways. The names carry no newline, which is the
one place `re`'s `.` and `$` differ from "any character" and "the end"; the listing refuses such
a name before it reaches a theme.
