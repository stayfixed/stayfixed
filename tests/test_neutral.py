"""No project-identifying string anywhere in the public repository — the whole tree.

Two copies of this gate, each scoped to one area, held the door before it; this whole-tree gate
replaced both, and no scoped copy is to be added beside it. Source under `src/`, `tests/` and
`scripts/` is held to the full table: a module has no reason to spell a default path. Every other
tracked text file is held to the public table, which exempts exactly the preset's own default
`[paths]` values, because a document that could not say where the note store lives by default would
be useless. The denylist is digests; the two docstrings this replaces say why, and their reasoning
is kept verbatim in `digest_of`.

**The denylist is stored as digests, not as the tokens themselves, and that is not decoration.**
A gate that lists the strings it is hiding publishes them: this file ships in a public repository,
so a plain-text list would put every identifier this gate forbids into the very tree the rule is
about, one `grep` away. Each entry is a lower-cased token's length and a short `blake2s` digest of
it; the scan hashes every window of each stored length and compares digests.
The behaviour is identical to the substring list it replaces — the same inputs fail — and a
digest is not a secret, it is merely not readable. **Do not "simplify" them back into
literals.** To add a token, run `digest_of("<token>")` and append `(len, digest)`.

    digests are intersected with the entries of that length. Every token is ASCII, so a window
    over bytes and a substring of the string agree, and this is exactly the `token in lowered`
    it replaces.

    **A digest hit carries the offset of its first matching window**, because without one this

    a twelve-hex digest naming neither the offset nor the window, against a table they cannot
    read by construction. Two entries are four characters long, which no one can brute-force by
    eye. The offset leaks nothing the tree did not already contain: the contributor reads the

    house style is em dashes, three bytes each. The entry's own stored length is the window's:
    say both, so the report is actionable without the table being readable.

    The shape arms keep their bare names. A shape is a regex a reader can look up in `SHAPES`
