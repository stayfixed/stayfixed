    """`NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is right for what it was written for and wrong for a diagnostic.

    Five minutes bounds `gh repo create --clone` waiting on GitHub and the clone behind it. It
    also bounded `doctor`'s `ci-ref` row, which reads one tag listing on a command documented as
    one line of output — and `stayfixed init` recording a `[ci] ref` is what made that block
    reachable at all. The bound belongs to the caller that knows how big its question is, so it
    is a keyword on the factory rather than a second module constant: the protocol is untouched
    and no stub in the suite grows a parameter it would ignore.

    Judged by what the subprocess did rather than by the wall: under a one-second bound, a
    command that would write a marker after five seconds answers `TIMED_OUT`, the marker is not
    there when the runner returns, and the sentence it carries names the bound that was applied
    and not the module's. The marker proves the call returned before the command's end, which is
    what a clock used to prove with a margin load can spend. That it never gets written later
    rests on `subprocess.run(timeout=)`, which kills `sh` before it reaches `: > finished`; the
    `sleep` it started outlives the test by about four seconds, writing nothing.

    Mutation (`mutations/`'s "the runner ignores the bound its caller asked for"): `timeout=bound`
    back to `timeout=NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Measured: the command runs to completion and the
    runner answers `Completed(code=0)`, so the code assertion is what reddens and the marker is
    the floor under it — a bound of five minutes cannot cut a five-second sleep.
