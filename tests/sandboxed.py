"""Writes refused as Claude Code's sandbox refuses an agent's shell a write outside the working
directory, for the tests of the writers that must say so rather than end in a traceback.

macOS's sandbox answers such a write with `PermissionError` `EPERM` (`trust.boundary`'s docstring
says how that was measured), so the stand-ins raise exactly that, through the `fsops` writers every
write goes through, and only for a target at or under the path a test names: every other write of
the run goes on as it would.
