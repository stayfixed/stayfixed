"""Every regular expression the package holds or builds from its own text, in a shape every
supported Python reads alike.

A possessive repeat (`*+`, `++`) is how a pattern here reads a long run without the record `re`
keeps for each pass of a repeated group, and Python 3.11.0 to 3.11.4 misread some of them: after a
pass of a possessive group fails, the match goes on from wherever the pass's last repeat, choice or
lookahead left off rather than from where the pass began (fixed in 3.11.5, gh-100061 and
gh-106052). So `docs/` read as a path, and `{hooks: x}` held no key. CONTRIBUTING.md ("Tests")
states the shape that reads alike everywhere; this holds every pattern to it, and the
`checks (ubuntu-latest, 3.11.4)` leg runs the readers' own tests where the bug lives.
