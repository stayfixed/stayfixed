"""The enumerated-writes rule (CONTRIBUTING.md#enumerated-writes) for `scaffold`: `apply` touches
the project root and nothing else.

Two instruments, because a tree diff and a syscall trace fail on different things. The diff answers
"did exactly the planned paths change"; it is blind to a write anywhere it does not walk, which is
the thing the enumerated-writes rule actually forbids. The trace answers "was any absolute path
outside the root opened for writing at all", and it sees `$HOME`, a created directory, a symlink and
a mode change.
