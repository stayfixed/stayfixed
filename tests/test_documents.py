"""The public documents are held to a contract, the way the skills are (tests/skills).

`README.md` and `docs/methodology/` are read by people who have not read the code, which is
why nothing in them may be wrong in a way a test could have caught: a relative link that
does not resolve, a command row the parser does not accept, a command with no row, a
citation with no source, a source nothing cites, a principle with no statement of how well
it is backed. None of these is a matter of taste, so none is left to review.

The three parser lines are the same three `tests/skills/test_skills.py` has, on purpose:
two modules asking the real parser the same question is two claims, and collapsing them would
make one of the two documents provable only through the other. This used to forbid a cross-module
import on the grounds that the test tree was not importable, which was false in both halves:
`tests/__init__.py` is tracked, nine modules import across it, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` carries no
such rule. `tests/snapshot.py` is where a helper two modules share
belongs.
