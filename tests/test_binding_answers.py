"""One binding question, one answer, on every surface that asks it.

`memory` commands, `attach`, `attach --check` and `doctor` each say whether this machine binds the
checkout. They used to answer it from the overlay's record of a remote, and a checkout whose
`origin` was removed was refused on every surface, each with a way out that refused in turn. The
binding is the id in the git common directory now, and a removed `origin` is a note: no surface
refuses for it.
