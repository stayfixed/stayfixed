"""A file a person or a repository owns that is not UTF-8 is its area's answer, never a crash.

stayfixed reads every such file as UTF-8, and `read_text` raises `UnicodeDecodeError` for one
that is not: a `ValueError`, so an `except OSError` beside it caught nothing and the command
ended in `internal error: UnicodeDecodeError` (exit 2) instead of the failure the same file
gets when it cannot be read or parsed. Each case below plants the bytes `\\xff\\xfe` at one
reader's file and asks for what that reader already answers a broken file with: a `Failure`
(or, for the `.gitignore` `attach` must write, a `Refusal`), or, where a reader treats an
unreadable file as absent, the same absent answer.

Mutation (by hand, per case): take `UnicodeDecodeError` out of the reader's `except` -> that
case reddens on the decode error itself. Three of these readers are declared in `mutations/`:
the two a command's first read meets, `stayfixed.toml` and the machine file ("a stayfixed.toml
that is not UTF-8 crashes every command that loads it" and "a machine file that is not UTF-8
crashes every command that loads the configuration"), and the trust gate's ("a trust record that
is not UTF-8 crashes instead of refusing loudly").
