"""No script under `scripts/` imports another, but the one exemption named here; CONTRIBUTING.md,
under "Areas", says why.

The walk reads every import statement in every `scripts/*.py` and the launcher `scripts/stayfixed`
through `tests/boundaries/astscan.py`, as the area rules do, and an offence is a module reached by a
sibling's stem or by the directory's own name, which a package-qualified or relative import goes
through. What it cannot see is reviewed by hand: a script run through `runpy` or loaded through
`importlib`, and a name built at run time. `sys.path` is not followed, so a module of a sibling's
name found elsewhere is an offence all the same.
