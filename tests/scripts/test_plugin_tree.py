"""`scripts/plugin_tree.py`: the plugin's paths read from a commit, as members, manifest and tree.

Every case builds a scratch repository and commits into it, because the subject is what a commit
holds and not what a disk does. The nine paths are spelled out in `tests/plugintree.py`, which
builds every source here, and never read from the script's `PLUGIN_PATHS`; the manifest's first
line and every commit text are spelled here and never read from the script: an expectation read
from the subject is the subject compared with itself.
