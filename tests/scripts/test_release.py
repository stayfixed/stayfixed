"""`scripts/release.py`: this repository's own release discipline, driven through `main(argv)`.

The three commands used to be the installed CLI's `release` group, and they only ever checked
the stayfixed repository itself; the exit codes and the `--json` shapes are the ones that group
had, and these tests are what holds them. The half of the release record that shipped code reads
— `HASHED_FILES`, `digests`, `read_record` and what it raises — stays in `stayfixed.release`,
and `tests/release/test_hashes.py` holds it, its happy path included: what `digests` computes,
and that no record reads as `None` and a record as the digests it names. What is here is the
writer and the drift check. towncrier is a development dependency and is *invoked*, never
imported; the argv is the contract, and a stub records it.

Every message that tells the reader which command to run again is asserted against the command
written out, `uv run python scripts/release.py …`, and never through the script's own
`COMMAND`: read from the script, the expectation was the script's text compared with itself,
and a script telling its reader to run a command that no longer exists stayed green.
