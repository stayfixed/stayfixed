"""`scripts/publish_plugin.py`: the plugin commit a release pins, built with the tag's own code and
pushed to the plugin's own repository, and nothing else.

Every case starts from `tests/plugintree.py`'s `tool_source`: one commit holding a file under each
of the plugin's nine paths, this branch's `scripts/plugin_tree.py` and `src/stayfixed`, and a
marketplace pinning the plugin commit its tree makes, tagged `v1.2.3` (annotated). The default one
is built once per session and cloned per case; a case that changes the tag's own code patches its
clone, or builds its own when the pin has to change with it. A bare repository in `tmp_path` stands
for the plugin repository.

`gh` is never run. The runner is a composite that records every argv it is handed, answers `gh`
from `GitHub` — `gh api` read from the local repositories standing for GitHub's, its attestations
from one scripted answer, everything else (`gh auth status` and `gh attestation verify` exit `0`
unless a case says otherwise) from a script — and runs the rest for real: `git`'s network half and
the tag's `plugin_tree.py`.
Every commit id a case expects is computed by git from a literal text (`tests/plugintree.py`), never
by the script. Which exit each outcome is — `1` to reject the release's approval, `2` to fix
something and run again — is held in one place, the table at the end, through the command's `main`.
