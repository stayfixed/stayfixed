"""The oracle's own guards, which nothing exercised.

`scripts/mutation_oracle.py` is the mechanism this project's strongest test convention rests
on — "every new assertion ships with the mutation that reddens it" — and it had no tests of its
own, so the two states it could not tell apart were invisible by construction: a mutation whose
named tests do not exist read as *caught*, and a `git status` that could not answer read as a
*clean tree*. Both are proved here, against a real pytest run and a real repository.
