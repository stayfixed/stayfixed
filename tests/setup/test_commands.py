"""The `setup` command surface: CLI wiring over `setup.run.setup` and `guards.githooks`.

`tests/setup/test_setup.py` and `tests/setup/test_git_hooks.py` already exercise the two
behaviours directly; what is untested until this file is the argparse wiring itself — the
group is registered, the flags reach the functions those tests call, and a real command-line
invocation exits 0.
