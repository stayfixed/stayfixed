"""`setup --approval-boundary`: the advice that keeps an agent's shell out of the trust record.

The record holds against repository bytes, and against an agent only while the harness's sandbox
keeps that agent's shell out of its directory, which is the person's to set and stayfixed's never
to check (`trust.boundary` says why). So the command prints the deny rule measured on Claude Code
2.1.296 (macOS) on 2026-10-16 -- `Edit(//<absolute path>/**)` in `permissions.deny` stopped both the
sandboxed shell and the file tools, where one leading slash and a `Write(...)` rule stopped neither
-- and the sandbox settings, and writes nothing. Every path the tests write is under `tmp_path`.
