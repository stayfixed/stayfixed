    `from stayfixed.memory import worktree` is the one a rule that looked only at `node.module`

    read `and not node.level`, so `from ..hooks.sink import DIRECTORY` inside `doctor/checks.py`
    walked straight past. There are no relative imports under `src/stayfixed/` today, but only by
    house style: ruff's `TID` rules are not selected, so nothing bans one, and the first
    contributor to write an idiomatic one would have reopened the boundary with the rule still
    green.

    Resolved rather than refused, so a rule answers the question it is named for in whatever
    spelling, instead of imposing a second rule the project has not made. `package` is the
    importing module's package, `("stayfixed", "doctor")` for `doctor/checks.py`; `level` counts
    the leading dots: one means that package, and each further dot strips one component off it.
