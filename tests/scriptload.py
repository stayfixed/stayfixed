"""The repository's scripts, loaded by path for the tests that drive them.

`scripts/` is not an importable package, so each script is loaded from its file. `load` is the one
loader: the mutation oracle's declarations (`tests/declarations.py`), the release script, the two
smoke scripts and the artifact checker all go through it, so a change to how a script is loaded is
made once. `release` is the release script, loaded once for every module that reads it — its own
tests, the repository's manifest test, and the two walks over every reader of a document that may
not parse. `plugin_tree` is the reader of the plugin's paths, loaded once in the same way: the
scripts run it as a program, and only the tests import it. `publish_plugin` is the publisher of
that tree to the plugin's own repository, loaded once for its tests.
