"""What every test runs under: a `HOME` of its own, so the product's own `git` reads no developer
configuration.

`tests/gitfixture.py` seals the `git` a fixture runs (`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`
at `os.devnull`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` set, `HOME` under `tmp_path`). The `git` the product
runs is another matter: `stayfixed.gitenv.scrubbed_env` keeps `HOME` on purpose, because a real
user's global excludes and configuration are theirs to have honoured, and it drops every
`GIT_CONFIG_*` variable. So
under test that `git` read the developer's `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/git/ignore`: with
`CLAUDE.md` in a global excludes file, `check-ignore` answered differently and the project
tests failed by the dozen on one machine and passed on the next.

Here, rather than in the product, because the product's behaviour for a real user is right; it
is the suite that must not depend on whose machine it runs on. `HOME` points at a fresh
directory for each test and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, which `git` reads before `HOME/.config`, is
dropped. A test that needs a global configuration writes one into that directory. What `HOME`
cannot seal is git's system configuration, which `scrubbed_env` gives no variable to redirect;
no shipped system file carries an excludes rule.

The directory is empty but for one file: a `.gitconfig` that turns git's automatic maintenance
off, with the two keys and for the reason `tests/gitfixture.py` gives the fixture's `git`.
`scrubbed_env` drops the variables that carry them there, and `HOME` is how the same two reach
the product's `git` — a ledger `fetch` starts maintenance like a `commit` does — and every
`stayfixed` and `Runner` launch a test starts, which inherit this `HOME`.
