"""Code, tests and documents cite what a reader here can open, and nothing else.

The design these modules were built against lives in a private repository. A `§9.1` or a
`(D7)` in a docstring therefore points a reader at a page they cannot open: it looks like a
reference and carries none of the content. Seventy-four files under `src/` did it before this
gate, eighty-two under `tests/`, and the mutation register, the scripts, the workflows,
`docs/cli.md`, the preset and the hook wrapper besides. The rule is to say what the section
says, in a few words, or to cite an anchor that exists in this repository — `docs/cli.md#…`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, or a principle of `docs/methodology/principles.md` by its number.

**Every tracked file is walked, and the exemptions are named.** `docs/plans/` is a historical
record of work argued from the design, and it keeps the ids it argued with; `CONTRIBUTING.md`
says its references cannot be followed from here. This file plants citations on purpose. A
list of trees to walk would be a list of trees to forget, and the class did arrive in one that
an earlier list left out.

**A file is read whole, not line by line.** Words are matched across any run of whitespace, so
a phrase a re-wrap split over two lines — "the Global" at the end of one, "Constraints" at the
start of the next — is the same phrase to the gate as to a reader.

The arms are deliberately wider than "a parenthesised id". The ids were written bare as often
as in brackets — `D7: a cap, not a config key`, `DP3 makes it trusted by construction`, `C5's
exit 2` — and an arm that saw only one spelling would have let most of the class back in. What
the width costs is a rewrite: an ordinary numbered use — `P95`, `the P1 bug`, `item 1 of the
tuple` in code — is refused too, and says it another way.
