"""The outbound walk: every process stayfixed's package starts, found in the package's syntax.

`tests/test_outbound.py` holds README.md's "What stayfixed sends where" to what this walk finds,
and this docstring is the one description of what it sees and what it cannot.

**What it finds.** A *launch* is a call that starts a process, a launcher named without being
called — handed to `functools.partial`, passed as a callback, bound to another name, used as a
base class — a star import of a launcher module or of a package module, which can re-export
one, or either kind of module named without an attribute after it (`m = subprocess`, `f(os)`,
`m = gitenv`), which hands on every launcher it holds. `getattr` and `hasattr` given a literal
name read the attribute it names, so `getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)` uses `os` rather than
handing it on, and `getattr(subprocess, "run")` names the launcher. The standard library's
launchers are `subprocess`, the `os` process functions (reached through `os`, `posix` or `nt`),
`pty.spawn`, `asyncio`'s subprocess calls and an event loop's.
The package's own start from the roots `tests/outbound/policy.py` names and grow by derivation:
a module-level function — one defined at the top of its module, or under a module-level `if`,
`try` or `with` — that hands its own argv on to a launcher in exactly one call, as the argv's
last part, is a launcher too, read at its callers. Its argv is its `*args`, or a list parameter,
spread or whole, that the function never rebinds or mutates. A function that hands its argv on
in two calls, a method and a nested function are not launchers: their own launches stay
findings until declared. A `Runner`'s `.launch` is a launcher by its attribute alone, whatever
holds the runner — a parameter, an attribute, a subscript, a call's result: no other method in
the package is named `launch`, and one that came to be would be read as a launch too, a finding
to read rather than a launch missed. A name is followed through every import, relative, dotted
or a re-export, to the module that defines it, a package module being one of the files the tree
lists under that exact name, whether or not the disk folds case.

**What it reads.** Each launch's argv, element by element: a string literal, or a module
constant holding a string or a list of strings, is read; anything else is `Unread`, carrying its
source text. A constant is one name the module binds exactly once and never mutates, so a
rebinding, an augmented assignment, an `.append` or a parameter of the same name makes it
`Unread`. A launch whose argv the walk cannot read at all — a shell string, a launcher handed on,
a starred argument before the argv's position — is one `Unread`. Each launch's `env=`,
`executable=` and `**` spread are recorded beside it as an `Override`: the first replaces what
the launch inherits, the second the program it runs, and the third can hand either.
`isinstance` and `issubclass` only compare a class, so a launcher named there is not handed on;
nor is one named as a type in an annotation, though a call there still runs, and is walked, when
the annotation is evaluated.

**What it cannot see.** The walk reads syntax, so a launch whose program, argv, environment or
receiver is decided by data flow it does not follow is beyond it. Each of these is probed to
return nothing:

- dynamic dispatch: `importlib.import_module`, `__import__`, `sys.modules`, and code run from
  data by `exec`, `eval` or `pickle`;
- aliasing: a launcher named as `Annotated` metadata, which code reading the annotation could
  call;
- values computed at run time: an argv element held in a variable is `Unread`, and the walk
  does not follow where its value came from, so `sh -c` handed a script the package builds from
  strings (`" ".join(["curl", url])`) is taken for the user's command, the `sh -c` row's;
- launches and connections the standard library makes on the package's behalf, at import or
  when called: `uuid.getnode()` can run `ifconfig`, `platform.architecture()` runs `file`,
  `xml.sax` fetches an external entity through `urllib.request`, `pydoc.browse` serves HTTP and
  `email.utils.make_msgid` asks DNS through `socket`, none of which the package imports by
  name;
- a process of the running interpreter that `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` starts,
  which runs the package's own code rather than another program.

`ctypes`, `_posixsubprocess` and `_winapi` start a process through no launcher the walk knows,
so the outbound test forbids importing them, beside the network modules, rather than walking
them.
