"""What stayfixed's launches may reach, declared: the policy `tests/test_outbound.py` holds the
package to, over what `tests/outbound/walk.py` finds.

The classification tables and the declarations are held both ways: a launch no entry accounts
for is a finding, and so is an entry no launch uses, because a declaration about nothing is
ready to excuse the next launch that matches it. The forbidden modules are held one way, since
nothing may import them, and a root launcher that named nothing would leave its own launch
unread, which is a finding too.

# which a match on names cannot tell apart, and the package imports it for neither. A module that
# wants it for a subprocess is an edit here that says so, and the launches it makes are walked
# like any other. `smtpd`, `asyncore` and `asynchat` are gone from 3.12 and importable on the 3.11
