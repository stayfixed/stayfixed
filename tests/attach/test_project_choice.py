"""Which overlay project `attach` binds a repository with no `stayfixed.toml` to.

A public clone the owner cannot commit to carries no `[project] name`, so the project comes, in
this order, from `--project`, from this machine's binding record, from the one overlay project
whose `project.toml` records this checkout's `origin`, and from the last segment of `origin`'s
path. Each step is a convenience and not a gate: the anchor is `origin`, which whoever cloned set,
and the screen names the project and the origin for the owner who ran the command to read.
