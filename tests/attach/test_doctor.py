"""What the `attached` row in `stayfixed doctor` answers, now that `attach` contributes it, and
what this area claims for the core's `hook-entries` row.

Every case runs the whole report through `run_checks`, so the row is asked the way a user's
`stayfixed doctor` asks it: discovered in this area's `doctor.py`, with the note store resolved by
the lazy value its `register()` creates and the overlay root by the report's `Context`. The
fixtures are the doctor
area's own (`tests/doctor/test_checks.py`), shared rather than respelled, because the core's
`hook-entries` cases read the same attached checkout.
