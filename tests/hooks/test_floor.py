"""The floor: a session's guards run whatever its configuration, and a configuration that does not
load whole is said once, at `SessionStart`, and never refuses a tool call
(`src/stayfixed/config/session.py`, `src/stayfixed/hooks/commands.py`).

Every hook here is a real `stayfixed hook` process (`tests/hooks/test_hook_command.py`'s `hook`),
under a home of its own: the machine file a hook reads is `<home>/.config/stayfixed/config.toml`,
which no variable moves, and none of these reads the developer's."""
