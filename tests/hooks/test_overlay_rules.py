"""The overlay's rules through `stayfixed hook`, end to end: a standing rule on `SessionStart` from
the core plugin, and a path-scoped one on the `PostToolUse` entry the rendered plugin carries.

Each case spawns the hook with a home of its own, which is where the machine file records the
overlay and where the binding record and the once-per-file record live.
