"""The plugin's tree held to the file rules the Claude plugin directory checks at submission.

The payload is the tree `scripts/plugin_tree.py` generates from `HEAD`: the files under the
plugin's paths and nothing else, because the plugin is published from a repository of its own whose
root is that tree (the marketplace entry is a `url` source naming it), and that tree is what the
directory scans. `test_the_payload_is_the_generated_plugin_tree` reddens if the walk reads anything
else. The commit and not the working tree, because the directory reads a commit: a local edit, a
line-ending conversion or a file deleted on disk is not what it scans.

Every rule holds the tree on every pull request, the file count included: the tree is the plugin
alone, so a pull request that carries it past `FILES_MAX` carries the plugin past it, and
`scripts/release.py check --tag` holds the same count again on the commit a release is cut from.

`docs/cli.md` and every other file outside the plugin's paths are not judged: the directory's
limits judge the files that ship, and these do not.
