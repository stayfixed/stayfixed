"""The one `git` the suite runs against a fixture repository, and the environment it runs in.

Twenty-three test modules each defined their own, and the copies had drifted apart in five
ways at once: thirteen inherited `os.environ` whole, seven pinned `HOME` under `tmp_path` and
thirteen left the developer's real one, five forced a committer identity and fifteen took
whatever the machine had, four never set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT`, and twelve lines across four
modules had drifted from `os.devnull` to the literal `"/dev/null"`. Nothing held them to each
other, so each fixture was protected by whichever subset its author happened to write.

Here rather than in each module because there is no reason left for the copies: the sentence
that used to justify them — "`tests/` is not a package (CONTRIBUTING…)" — was false and is
gone from CONTRIBUTING.md, `tests/__init__.py` is tracked, and `tests/snapshot.py` is the
precedent for a shared test module.

**The environment is sealed rather than inherited, and that is the hardening.** An inherited
`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` or `GIT_INDEX_FILE` points `git` at a repository other than the one
it was given — which is the defect `stayfixed.gitenv` and `stayfixed.runner` both exist to close,
and it is worse here than in production: these calls are `init`, `add` and `commit`, so a
redirected fixture does not read the wrong repository, it *writes* to it. `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`
and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` go to `os.devnull` for the reason `tests/memory/test_store.py` gave in
prose: `commit.gpgsign`, `core.hooksPath` and `init.templateDir` can each hang or fail a commit
that has nothing to do with the code under test. `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` is set beside them
because on macOS the second is not enough: Apple's git also reads a gitconfig inside Xcode that
no path variable replaces, and that file names the default branch.

**`PATH` is passed through rather than pinned**, for the reason `stayfixed.gitenv`'s module
docstring gives about production: the machine owner's own `git` is the one that must answer,
and a hardcoded `/usr/bin:/bin` is what picks the Xcode shim on macOS over the `git` they
installed. Two modules pinned it; that was a narrowing nothing needed, and this widens it.

**The committer identity is forced**, so a machine whose `user.email` is only in the global
configuration this module has just pointed at `os.devnull` can still commit, and so that two
runs of the same fixture on two machines produce the same author. Three modules were passing
`-c user.email=…` at the call site to buy exactly this; those call sites still work and are
now merely redundant.

**Git's automatic maintenance is off**, because it outlives the command that started it. A
`commit`, `merge`, `fetch`, `pull`, `am` or `rebase`, and the `receive-pack` behind a push, ends
by starting `git maintenance run --auto --detach`, and from git 2.55 the process that detaches
keeps `objects/maintenance.lock` until its background work is done — after the fixture's
`commit` has returned. A test that removes or walks `.git` straight after one races it: on
2026-10-05 `shutil.rmtree(root / ".git")` listed the lock and then found it gone, and the test
failed with `FileNotFoundError: 'maintenance.lock'` on one leg of four (Python 3.13's `rmtree`
ignores a file that vanishes; 3.11's and 3.12's raise). `maintenance.auto = false` stops the
spawn, and `gc.auto = 0` stops the `gc --auto` an older git ran in its place. They go in as
`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` entries, which reach every `git` the fixture's own starts in the same
repository. They do not reach the other side of a push to a local remote: git unsets
`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` for the `receive-pack` it starts there, so a pushed-to bare repository can
still be left with maintenance running, and no test removes or walks one after pushing to it.
The `git` the product runs reads neither variable, and `tests/conftest.py` gives it the same two
keys through the `HOME` it does read.

`home` defaults to `root.parent`, which is inside `tmp_path` for every fixture in this suite:
CONTRIBUTING.md's Tests section holds a test to never reading or writing the developer's real
home, and pointing the two configuration variables at `os.devnull` is the first half of that,
not the whole of it.
