"""`doctor` on a repository with nothing configured, and the owner's preferences row

A default install has no `stayfixed.toml`, and the guards and `doctor` work there, so the report
warns that the rest needs `stayfixed init` and is red about nothing. The report reads the
configuration the way a session does (`config.session`): a file that loads with notes is a warning
listing the keys, and only a file that falls back whole is red, in the session's words."""
