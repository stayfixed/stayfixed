"""What `doctor` answers about an installation, and what it refuses to guess.

`codex-hooks`, the one check this build could not answer, left the report: what holds on Codex is
the README's reach table now, since a row no build can answer is a row that never clears. `ci-ref`
skips on a state of the repository, since `init` writes `[ci] ref`, and not on a limit of this
build.

`git` is required by the fixtures below rather than by the code under test: an attached
repository is one whose `origin` the overlay recorded, and `read_binding` compares the two.
The same `pytestmark` `tests/attach` carries, for the same reason.
