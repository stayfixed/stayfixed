"""How the report finds the rows an area contributes through its own `doctor.py`, and what an
area that cannot contribute gets in their place: `stayfixed.doctor.registry`, and the run that
reads it.

The fake areas below are modules, or an import's exception in an area's place, injected through
`registry.discover_contributors`, the seam the discovery reads, the way `tests/test_cli.py`
replaces `cli.discover_registrars`: a test that shipped a real `doctor.py` to prove the
convention would be a check in every user's report. With the fakes in place no real area is
discovered, so what these cases prove is the core's reading of a contribution; what a real area
answers is proven in that area's own tests. `tests/doctor/test_entries.py` injects them the same
way, to tell `hook-entries` what each area claims.
