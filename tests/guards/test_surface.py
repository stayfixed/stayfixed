    # This list is the contract. A consumer that needs something absent from it grows the list
    # deliberately, in a commit that says which consumer and why — and an EQUALITY is what makes
    # that true. `required <= set(__all__)` let an export be added and pass, and so did the
    # parse that compares `__all__` against this module's own imports: adding an import and an
    # `__all__` entry together satisfied both, so between them the two could only catch a
    # REMOVED export.
    #
    # No entry in `mutations/`: the mutation is adding an export, which is two lines in
    # `api.py` (the import and the `__all__` entry) and not one substituted line. Measured by
    # hand instead — re-exporting `hygiene.red_exit` reddens this test and this test alone,
    # and under the old `required <= set(...)` the very same change left all three tests green.
