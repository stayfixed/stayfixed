"""Contract for the background-cleanup guard, driven through `judge`.

The command this guard exists to refuse was measured on 2026-09-02: a session backgrounded
fourteen busy-loop subshells with a bare ``&`` and expressed the cleanup as a LATER LINE of
the same command. The harness reaped the parent shell before that line ran, the subshells
re-parented to PID 1, and they burned 7.4 of 10 cores for 39 minutes with no writer left to
stop them. A trailing ``kill`` line is not cleanup; ``trap ... EXIT`` is.

    Measured as a RATIO against a benign cluster of the same length, not against a clock. An
    absolute ceiling of three seconds held on one machine and failed on another: under coverage
    across four workers on a CI runner the fixed call spent 3.07 s of CPU (Python 3.12,
    2026-09-26), because coverage traces `judge`'s pure-Python scan line by line and shared cores
    stretch the same work into more CPU-seconds. Both calls below run through `judge` back to
    back, so whatever inflates one inflates the other. A `b` cluster takes the same path to the
    same verdict but gives the flag pattern nothing to backtrack over. Measured: 1.0 with the
    fixed pattern and 1.1 under coverage; with the old one, 48 and 19. Five sits between them
    with room on both sides.

    `cmd 2> err.log` and `sleep 5 > out.log` tokenize to the identical shape --
