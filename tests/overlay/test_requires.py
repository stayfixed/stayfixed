# answers, kept by the one comparison that replaced it; a differential over ten million floors and
# versions found no other difference. `1.0.0rcdev` and `1.0.0adev1` are a pre-release word run into
# its `dev`, which a reading of each segment as a word of its own met the floor with. Mutations
# (oracle): `mutations/`'s "the declared floor is met by a pre-release of it", "the declared floor
# stops being met by the version that equals it" and "the declared floor is not met by the version
# equal to it" -> the rows of the floor's own triple. The segments PEP 440 lets run together with no
# separator are read as it reads them: `1.0.0.post1dev2` is `1.0.0.post1.dev2`, which met the floor
# at 0.2.0 and then stopped meeting it under a search for each segment as a word of its own, and
# `1.0.0rc1post2` is a pre-release that search met the floor with. A further release component other
# than zero is a later release, `1.0.0.1rc1` among them. Mutations (oracle): `mutations/`'s
# "segments run together are no suffix PEP 440 allows", "a further release component is read as no
# later release", "a local label is no part of the suffix grammar", "a pre-release segment no longer
# makes a pre-release", "a development release of a post-release reads as a pre-release" and "a
# suffix outside PEP 440 reads as a pre-release". The answers agree with `packaging`'s ordering over
# every combination of segment, spelling and separator, 5,055 versions, checked offline.
