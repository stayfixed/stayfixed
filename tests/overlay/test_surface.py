"""The overlay area's `api.py` is held to the same contract every other area's is.

CONTRIBUTING states it once for all of them: "`api.py` is the area's import surface. Other
areas import from it and from nothing else, and its `__all__` must equal exactly what it
imports — a test parses the file and checks."

This area shipped with the install path and without the test, and it was the new surface with
the most consumers — `attach`, `doctor` and `setup` all imported from it, and `attach` and `setup`
still do — so it is the one whose contract went unasserted longest.
