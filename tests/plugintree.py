"""The builders of a source repository holding the plugin's nine paths, for the tests reading one.

`scripts/plugin_tree.py`'s own tests, the payload walk (`tests/test_payload.py`) and the release
check's tag tests (`tests/scripts/test_release.py`) each built such a repository with a copy of
these, and the copies had drifted: three spellings of the nine paths, two of the files under them,
and a payload test importing its builder from another test module. Here once, as
`tests/gitfixture.py` is for the `git` they run.

The nine paths and the files under them are spelled out here and never read from the script's
`PLUGIN_PATHS`: an expectation read from the subject is the subject compared with itself. Every
`git` goes through `tests.gitfixture.git`, the sealed runner, so the developer's configuration
never shapes a fixture; a test that means the owner's configuration writes it into the test
`HOME`'s `.gitconfig`, which only the code under test reads.

The plugin commit a test expects is computed the same way in every module that expects one: its
text spelled out (`literal`), its tree and its id computed by git (`plugin_tree_id`, `hashed`),
and never by the script's `plugin_commit`.

`tool_source` is the publisher's source: a repository whose tag carries its own
`scripts/plugin_tree.py` and `src/stayfixed`, as a release's does, so the publisher can run the
tag's code; `released` adds a later release on top of one.
