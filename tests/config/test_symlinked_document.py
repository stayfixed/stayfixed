"""A `stayfixed.toml` that is a symlink, met by every command family that loads the configuration.

There were two readers of the file: `stayfixed gate`, `assess` and `init` went through
`read_document`, which refuses a symlink, and every other command through a plain `read_text`,
which follows one. A clone's `stayfixed.toml -> /dev/zero` then kept `adopt`, `bugs check` and
`plan check` reading until the machine ran out of memory. `load` now reads through
`read_document`, so each family below is refused before anything is read. The link here points
at a valid document, so a reader that follows it would load it and go on: the refusal is the
only thing that can make these cases pass, and a regression cannot hang the suite.
