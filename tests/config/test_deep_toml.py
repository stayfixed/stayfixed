"""Every reader of a TOML document somebody else wrote, handed one past a limit of the parser.

`tomllib` reads nested arrays by recursion, so `a = [[[…]]]` a few thousand levels deep raises
`RecursionError`, not `TOMLDecodeError`; and an integer literal longer than the interpreter
converts raises a plain `ValueError`, which is not a `TOMLDecodeError` either. Uncaught, each is an
internal error, the class stayfixed keeps for its own defects; in a gate run it ended every gate,
and in `stayfixed.toml` it replaced "does not load" with a traceback's name. So each reader answers
both as it answers a document that does not parse, and each case below holds one reader to its own
answer.
