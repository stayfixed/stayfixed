"""`stayfixed init --yes`'s answers: each reaches the document this run creates, a fresh
repository gates the branch it chose, and every file `--local` offers leaves every gate green.

The answers are given here as `Given` straight to `init`; `tests/project/test_command.py` gives
them as flags through the real parser, built from `init --questions --json`.
