"""The whole path a person takes onto stayfixed, run as one scenario through the real parser: the
questions, `init --yes` with an answer, `assess`, an adoption design and plan with an accurate
trail, `adopt promote`, and an `upgrade` that keeps a hand edit.

Each command's own tests hold one guard each. What none of them holds is the composition: that
the repository one command leaves is one every later command accepts, on a base branch that is
not `main`. A failure here is a defect between commands, not a reason to weaken a step.

Nothing reaches the network. The runner the CLI builds is stubbed for the whole scenario at the
seam `tests/project/test_command.py` stubs (`stayfixed.runner.subprocess_runner`), answering a
release tag at the running version: `init` resolves its pin through it, and so do `upgrade
--dry-run` and `upgrade`, which read the pinned `[ci] ref`.

Neither scenario declares a mutation. Every guard it composes has its own entry against the
narrower test that states it, and a scenario that one mutation reddens proves less than those do.
