"""`stayfixed init` through the real parser: the flags, the exit codes and the `--json` keys.

Nothing here reaches the network, and it is kept out three ways. Every case that writes or plans
a footprint but one goes through `_invoke`, which appends `--no-ci`: with `[ci] mode` set to
`none` the run never asks the `release` package to resolve a pin, so the `subprocess_runner()`
`commands.py` builds is never handed a `git ls-remote` against the public repository. The one
case that must resolve a pin — the hostile `gate_branch` arm, which exists precisely because
`_ci` reaches that check *after* the pin — stubs `subprocess_runner` at the seam `commands.py`
builds it from and answers one released tag from a string. The `--questions` cases go through
`_run`, because `--questions` resolves no pin and refuses `--no-ci` beside it.
