"""Every footprint command plans through `project.footprint.Passes`, and nothing else in the
project area plans at all.

`Passes` binds the ownership relation into every plan and runs the ignore guard over every
prediction, so a command that plans through it cannot leave either behind. The engine's own `plan`
keeps its `owners` keyword optional, because `stayfixed.overlay` keeps nothing out of git and has no
relation to pass; so the seam is what holds the project area, and this is what holds the seam.
Required instead, the keyword would make every overlay call and a hundred engine tests say
`owners=None`, and would still let a new command (`adopt`) pass `None` beside them: the bypass is
importing the planner, so that is what is checked.
