    entry was overwritten with the new place, no action named the old copy, and `uninstall`
    refused over it with a `--force` that did nothing. Now the old copy is judged at the place the
    ledger records: unedited it goes on `upgrade`, and edited it is named, keeps its entry, and
    `--force` with its path takes it.

    Mutation (oracle): "a left copy is judged only where [artifacts] local no longer lists its id"
    -> the unedited case keeps the old copy, and the uninstall refuses.
