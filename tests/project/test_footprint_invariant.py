"""One invariant for `init`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`, `assess` and `adopt promote`, asked of every
hostile input at once.

A write or removal must never land on a file whose bytes the committer does not control and git
does not show. The inputs that could aim one are repository-authored: the committed
`stayfixed.toml` (`[paths]`, `[artifacts] local`), the committed manifest, and the local ledger a
clone can force-add; and, at `init`, the answers a person passes as flags, which `precheck`
keeps off any committed document. Each hostile case below is one such input, run at every
command that meets it — `init` reads `[paths]` from a fresh clone; `upgrade` and `uninstall` act
on recorded targets, so they meet a `[paths]` value only together with a record placing the
artifact there.

- **I1, nothing hidden is clobbered.** After every command, finished or refused, each file the
  case planted where git does not show it — an ignored file, a file under `.git/`, stayfixed's
  out-of-git state, another artifact's kept-out-of-git copy — is present with its bytes, and no
  file has appeared under `.git/`.
- **I2, the legitimate user is not refused.** The legitimate cases run their commands to the
  end: no `Refusal` raised, and no refusal returned in the report's plans, which is the other
  way a command refuses.
- **I3, the end state is consistent.** After a finished `init`, `assess` or `upgrade`, a
  dry-run `upgrade` of the same tree plans nothing and refuses nothing: every artifact the
  configuration builds is at its own place with its own bytes. After a finished `uninstall`, a
  second one says there is nothing to uninstall, and stayfixed's own directory is gone.

Mutations (declared): each guard of the class put back one at a time — the ignore guard, the
shared `.git` predicate and its case folding, the `.stayfixed` reservation, the ledger's and the
collision rule's ownership checks — and guards made to refuse more than they should, which the
legitimate cases catch. An entry names every row it reddens; a row no single line can redden
says so where it is declared.

**Why `assess` joins the legitimate rows only.** The hostile inputs above are the ones that can
aim a write — `[paths]`, `[artifacts] local`, a manifest record, the local ledger — and
`assess`'s one write is a constant path under stayfixed's reserved directory, which none of them
reaches: the loader refuses a `[paths]` value naming it. What can reach that path is its shape
in a clone, a committed symlink or directory there, which `tests/assess/test_command.py` holds.
Its I2 and I3 lines have no mutation of their own: `assess` has no guard whose removal makes it
raise a refusal or plan work for `upgrade`.

**`adopt promote` writes one place, `stayfixed.toml`,** through the editor `upgrade` uses, with
the manifest's record of it re-stamped beside it. No repository value aims that write, and it
does not ask the ignore guard, which exempts the fixed names so that a person may keep
`stayfixed.toml` out of git: the legitimate rows run it to the end, once with the file in the
clone's excludes. What can aim it is the file's own shape, a committed
`stayfixed.toml` that is a symlink to a hidden file, which the one hostile row holds.

What this module does not cover: guards that decide nothing about a hidden file's bytes, such
as the attach refusal and the refusals over files `uninstall` would leave under
`.stayfixed/local/`, which their own modules hold.
